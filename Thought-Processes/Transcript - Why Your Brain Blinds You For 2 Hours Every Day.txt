Transcript - Why Your Brain Blinds You For 2 Hours Every Day


0:02
The world you see is not real –
0:04
you're not living in this very moment that you  are experiencing and nothing is like it seems.
0:09
It turns out your brain constructs  your reality as you are experiencing it,
0:13
it edits your memories as they happen,  
0:16
it lives in totally different time spheres  and tells you a story about the world that feels real.
0:21
What's going on and who  is really in control of your life?
0:25
The Gap Between Reality and You
0:28
Vision is maybe our main source of information about the world –
0:32
but in reality we don’t really see that much.
0:34
Only a thumbnail sized area of your visual field is in high resolution,
0:39
while the rest is out of focus. 
0:41
If it doesn’t feel like this, that’s because it is made up by your brain – using a pretty neat trick.
0:47
Each second your eyes make 3 to 4 sudden  jerky movements, saccades, of 50 milliseconds,
0:53
focusing from one point to another.
0:55
Scanning your environment to get different sharp images that your brain then edits together.
1:00
During a saccade your brain shuts down your vision so you don’t see a wild motion blur.
1:05
This means that each day, for around 2 hours, you're completely blind.
1:09
If you could actually see what your eyes  see, it would look something like this:
1:14
brrrr
1:15
brrrrrrrrr
1:17
Instead your brain fills this time with its best  guesses of what happened during the blackness.  
1:22
But it does way more – it turns out that you're not really experiencing time correctly.
1:27
What's really happening when you are stirring milk into a cup of coffee?
1:31
As the spoon hits the ceramic, light reflects off it and hits your eyes after 1.3 nanoseconds.
1:38
The ceramic vibrates and creates a shockwave of air molecules that travels to your ear in 1.2 milliseconds.
1:44
Heat is picked up by fibres in your fingers that send a signal to your brain in 50 milliseconds.
1:50
Three very different inputs, all processed in your brain at different times.
1:55
You don’t experience them separately but as one smooth, simultaneous and connected moment.
2:00
Your brain takes a moment to process and then invents a reality, a present moment that's not real.
2:06
What you feel is “now” is in fact a selectively edited version of the past.
2:11
You really only consciously experience the  world 0.3 to 0.5 seconds after things happened.
2:17
Except this is also not really true.
2:20
Because your brain is editing time and space way more than that.
2:24
And it makes decisions  completely out of your conscious control.
2:28
You Are Living in the Past!
2:30
No, future!
2:32
No, a made up future!
2:35
Your present, what you experience right now is kind of the future.
2:39
Imagine for a second that you are a table tennis pro.
2:42
In pro table tennis balls woosh around at 25 meters per second, which is pretty fast, so let’s slow down time.
2:49
Light passes from the ball to your eye in nanoseconds,  
2:52
is converted into electrical impulses that reach  your brain to be processed after 100 milliseconds.
2:58
Meanwhile, the ball travels 2.5 meters through the air, the length of the table.
3:03
If your brain showed you the past, where the ball was 100 milliseconds ago, it would hit you before you could react.
3:09
So instead your brain takes its location, speed and direction
3:13
and calculates where the ball should be in the future – by the time the information reaches you.
3:18
And then it creates a fictional version of it.
3:20
This is what you see, in your fake  present: a fake ball, that's somewhere else.
3:25
But you don’t need to just see the ball, you want to smash it back hard.
3:29
If you acted now and started swinging your arm you'd miss by a mile –
3:33
things are just too fast.
3:35
So before the ball even touches your opponent's bat,
3:38
your brain starts predicting where it will  likely be in space after they hit.
3:42
Based on the other player's posture and your table tennis experience.
3:46
But as it can’t be sure if it will be correct,  it prepares multiple different responses.
3:50
Maybe the ball will be here, or here, or even here.
3:54
To be ready for all of these scenarios your brain sends preprogrammed orders
3:58
to the muscles you need to jump left, right or up.
4:01
Telling them to be ready for any of them at a moment's notice.
4:04
For a short moment multiple ghost versions of you exist, all equally real inside your brain.
4:09
And then, as your opponent is about to lay into the swing,
4:12
your brain decides on a single future that it thinks is most likely.
4:16
All but one ghost are deleted.
4:18
You only ever experience the  ghost that won, never the potential ones.
4:22
The order to the muscles to act out the winning  movement is triggered, even before the ball is hit back to you.
4:28
You are totally oblivious to this –
4:30
by the time you consciously see the ball  coming at you and decide to hit it in a particular way,
4:34
your body has already hit it back.
4:37
In reality your brain already made all the decisions.
4:40
Your conscious experience is nothing more than an invented future,
4:44
a prediction based on the information your brain received a fraction of a second ago.
4:48
This is not just true for extreme sports  like uhm ... table tennis, but also for walking.
4:55
Walking is Time Travel
4:57
After your game you are walking back home,  seemingly choosing your path and reacting to things.
5:02
Meanwhile your brain is operating in three different time spheres at once.
5:06
It processes the sensory feedback of the past,
5:09
it calculates the current state of your body and it predicts your future.
5:12
Because walking is intense.
5:15
Before the signal from your foot touching  the ground has even reached the brain,
5:18
it's already sent the order to your foot to make the next step –
5:21
and it has already calculated  the muscle patterns for the next two.
5:25
But what if something truly catastrophic happens?
5:28
There's a banana peel and you step on it and slip –
5:31
how did it get here? Listen, don’t worry about it.
5:33
It turns out your brain is ready for this.
5:36
So far we spoke of your “brain” making  decisions for you but this is not really true.
5:41
You don’t have a central control  room where the world comes together.  
5:44
In reality different parts of your body are aware of different things, at different times.
5:49
Your spinal cord usually knows stuff before your brain.
5:53
And even within your brain different regions process the same event at different speeds
5:57
and make independent decisions.
5:59
As your foot catches the peel, the gyroscope inside your ears notices a sudden change of your position in space.
6:06
It submits this information to your brain stem and spinal cord,
6:09
the “things must happen quickly” section of your body.
6:12
They immediately trigger emergency recovery patterns and send orders to different muscle groups.
6:18
Within 200 milliseconds pre-programmed sequences activate to catch your fall.
6:23
Your arms shoot out,  your other leg stiffens to support your weight, your core muscles contract to stabilise you.
6:29
100 milliseconds later, when you become aware that you are tripping, your body is already recovering.
6:35
You are only just now catching up.
6:37
Ok, so we've learned that your brain is constantly predicting reality around you,
6:41
makes decisions about the best way to act and then shows you an edited version.
6:45
Which totally makes sense, would you really want to be in charge of that?
6:49
But your brain is not just predicting the external world.
6:52
Right now it's predicting a way more complex thing:
6:56
You.
6:57
Are YOU just a Prediction of your Brain?
7:01
Why do you feel about the world the way you do?
7:03
Your sense of hunger, your energy  level and especially your emotions
7:08
are not just objective reactions to what state you are in, but predictions.
7:12
Your brain's prediction of what you'll need soon or need to be ready for.
7:17
You are probably used to getting food or going to bed roughly around the same time –
7:21
and as time approaches your brain releases hormones to prepare you.
7:24
A self fulfilling prophecy.
7:26
You get hungry or tired because your brain assumes this is the time when this is needed.
7:31
This is the most striking thing about your emotions.
7:35
They aren't just reactions to the outside world – they're predictions.
7:39
When you go to a party, your brain isn't waiting to see how you feel once you get there,
7:43
based on how the party actually is.
7:46
It analyses your experiences of past  parties and who it expects to be there –
7:50
maybe close friends you feel safe around,
7:52
maybe people you don’t know who are a less socially secure bet.
7:57
Maybe your brain remembers a party where you felt anxious, and that experience stuck.
8:02
This could be pretty annoying –
8:03
if your brain predicts anxiousness, it adjusts your heart rate, hormone levels and muscle tensions
8:09
before you even enter the room.
8:11
It prepares your body for anxiety, making you actually feel anxious.
8:15
Which then confirms the brain's  prediction and gets saved for future reference. 
8:20
Does this make you feel like you are just along for the ride,
8:23
forced to experience whatever predictions your brain feeds you?
8:26
Thankfully it’s not quite like that.
8:29
Your conscious self is obviously not the decider of most things as you go through your day.
8:34
But that is not what it's good at anyway.
8:36
Your brain and all of these different organ systems decide a lot of things,
8:40
but they are more like butlers  taking care of all the busy work.
8:44
You may not be in the driver's seat, but you are  the passenger that decides where to go.
8:49
What your conscious self is good at is long term planning and abstract thinking.
8:54
It's a storyteller that tells the story of your life to your brain and to yourself –
8:59
wherever the edges of these  overlapping entities melt into each other.
9:03
You are able to see the big picture
9:06
that your internal prediction machine could never begin to grasp.
9:10
You are the part of you that can edit and write new predictions into the system.
9:15
Sometimes you and your brain disagree on what is correct –
9:18
but in the end you are the person in power, who tells the story about who you are in this world.
9:24
A story so convincing that you experience it as undeniable reality.
9:28
And as a happy accident, your conscious self is great at being happy about ice cream,
9:33
fascinated by internet videos and thinking deeply about pokemon types.
