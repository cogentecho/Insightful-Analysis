in his new book Nexus a brief history of
0:02
information networks from the Stone Age
0:04
to AI bestselling author and historian
0:08
Yuval Noah Harari looks at how we got
0:10
here and what we need to do next in an
0:13
age where artificial intelligence poses
0:15
unique challenges and he's joining
0:17
Walter isacson now thank you and you Val
0:21
Noah Harari welcome back to the show
0:24
thank you it's good to be here again
0:26
your bestselling book sapiens was about
0:29
how we meaning our species Homo sapiens
0:33
became dominant and it's mainly about
0:35
how we were able to form networks of
0:38
cooperation your new book Nexus is about
0:41
Communications and how they help to form
0:44
those networks but it's rather
0:46
pessimistic I think you say the way
0:48
these networks are built predisposes us
0:51
to use that power unwisely tell me about
0:56
that theme well the basic question of
0:59
the book of Nexus is if humans are so
1:04
smart why are we so stupid we've named
1:08
our species Homo sapiens which means
1:11
Wise Wise humans and we know a lot more
1:15
than any other animal on the planet
1:17
we've reached the moon we can split the
1:19
atom we can decode and write DNA and
1:23
nevertheless we are on the verge of
1:26
destroying ourself and much of the e EOS
1:30
system um so this is the Paradox at at
1:33
the center of of of the book and of
1:36
course humans have been concerned with
1:38
this Paradox throughout history and many
1:41
mythologies and theologies they blamed
1:44
human nature that there is something
1:46
wrong with human nature which causes us
1:50
to be self self
1:52
self-destructive the book Nexus gives a
1:54
different answer the problem is not with
1:57
our nature it's with our information
2:00
if you give good people bad information
2:04
they make bad decisions they make
2:07
self-destructive decisions and we are
2:10
now seeing it all around us you know we
2:12
have the most sophisticated information
2:15
technology in history and at the same
2:18
time we are losing the ability to talk
2:21
with each other to listen to each other
2:24
you know there is maybe one thing that
2:26
Democrats and Republicans in the United
2:28
States can agree on is that the
2:30
Democratic conversation is breaking down
2:33
everybody accuses the the other side of
2:35
course but the basic fact is that um
2:39
this this ability which sustains
2:42
democracy to hold a reasonable
2:45
conversation it is breaking down at
2:49
exactly the same moment that we have
2:52
supposedly the best information
2:54
technology in history you say the flaws
2:57
aren't in our nature it's in our
2:59
Communications networks yes what are the
3:01
flaws in those communication networks
3:04
the basic misunderstanding is about what
3:07
information does what information is
3:10
information isn't truth this naive view
3:14
which dominates in places like Silicon
3:16
Valley that you just need to flood the
3:18
world with more and more information and
3:22
as a result we will have more knowledge
3:25
and more wisdom this is simply not true
3:28
because most information is
3:31
junk the truth is a very rare and costly
3:36
kind of
3:37
information the basic function of
3:40
information in most cases is not to
3:43
reveal the truth the basic function is
3:47
to connect to connect large numbers of
3:50
people into networks and the easiest way
3:55
to connect large numbers of people is
3:57
not with the truth it with fictions and
4:01
Fantasies and mass delusions and what
4:04
should be done about that should
4:06
governments actually step in we're
4:08
watching that happen a bit um there two
4:11
things that should be done at the
4:13
governmental level and there is
4:15
something to be done on the individual
4:16
level on the governmental level the two
4:19
most obvious things to do is to ban fake
4:24
humans that uh we don't want algorithms
4:28
pretending to be be
4:30
humans uh and thereby distorting our
4:34
information systems if you go online
4:37
let's say to Twitter and you you see
4:39
that a story has a lot of traction a lot
4:42
of traffic and you think oh a lot of
4:44
humans are interested in this so I
4:47
should also get involved but actually
4:49
it's not humans it's Bots and algorithms
4:53
this should be banned so uh we shouldn't
4:56
have the situation when algorithms that
4:59
tend to be humans are running our
5:03
conversations the other thing is that
5:05
corporations should be liable for the
5:08
actions of their algorithms whenever you
5:11
talk about it with the big tech
5:13
companies they immediately raise the
5:15
flag of freedom of speech we don't want
5:19
to uh uh uh censor our users the problem
5:23
is not with the human users humans
5:26
produce enormous amount of content some
5:29
of it hate and greed but there is also a
5:31
lot of other good content the problem is
5:35
that the corporate algorithms of Twitter
5:38
and Facebook and Tik Tok and so forth
5:41
they
5:42
deliberately spread the hate and the
5:46
fear and the greed because this is good
5:48
for their business interests and this is
5:51
what they should be liable for for the
5:54
decisions and actions of their
5:56
algorithms not for the what the human
5:59
users are doing you've talked about uh
6:02
humans having some misinformation and
6:06
then you've talked about the way the
6:07
algorithms work is there a difference
6:10
between an organic uh information system
6:14
meaning human information system and an
6:17
inorganic
6:19
one yes there are many differences one
6:23
is that organic entities like us like
6:26
human beings we work in Cycles
6:30
there is day and night winter and summer
6:34
sometimes we are active sometimes we
6:36
need rest we need sleep the algorithms
6:39
are tireless they never need to rest
6:42
they are not organic and what we see in
6:45
the world now is that they increasingly
6:47
Force us to work according to their Pace
6:52
there is never any time to rest the news
6:56
Cycles is always on the mark are always
7:00
on the political game is always on and
7:04
if you force an organic entity to be on
7:07
all the time to be always active always
7:10
excited it eventually collapses and dies
7:14
and you know the most misunderstood and
7:17
abused word in the English language
7:20
today is the word
7:22
excited a lot of people mistake the word
7:25
excited for happy like they meet
7:28
somebody they say oh I'm so excited to
7:30
meet you or like you publish a new book
7:32
oh this is so exciting now excitement is
7:35
not always good excitement for an
7:39
organic being like a human being means
7:41
that your nervous system and your brain
7:44
are very engaged very active now if you
7:48
keep an organic system very excited all
7:52
the time it breaks down collapses and
7:55
eventually dies and this is what happens
7:58
now to democracy all over the world this
8:00
is what is happening to to humanity we
8:03
are far too excited we need time to rest
8:08
we need to kind of slow down and because
8:11
we give increasing control of the world
8:14
to
8:15
tireless nonorganic algorithms that
8:18
never need to rest and can just increase
8:22
the excitement all the time we are
8:24
breaking down we need more modom not
8:28
excitement in in politic in economics in
8:31
many fields when we talk about
8:33
artificial intelligence and we say how
8:36
it's going to change the way we
8:38
distribute information and either
8:39
Empower people or Empower uh
8:42
tyrannies sometimes people reflect back
8:44
on the last huge advance in information
8:48
uh technology spread which was Gutenberg
8:51
500 years ago doing the movable type
8:54
printing press you kind of debunk that
8:56
you say artificial intelligence is is
9:00
very Insidious compared to the pretty
9:03
good things that come out of the
9:04
printing press well there is a myth that
9:08
you know
9:10
Gutenberg broad print to Europe and as a
9:14
result we got the Scientific Revolution
9:16
and all the wonders of modern science
9:19
this is a very very inaccurate
9:21
misleading view of of History um almost
9:25
200 years passed from the invention of
9:29
print until the flowering of the
9:31
Scientific Revolution during these 200
9:35
years the main effects of print on
9:38
Europe was a wave of Wars of religion
9:42
and witch hunts and things like that
9:44
because the big best sellers of early
9:46
modern Europe were not Copernicus and
9:50
Galileo galile almost nobody read them
9:53
the big best sellers were religious
9:56
tracks and were uh witch hunting manuals
9:59
but it also was the Bible and that
10:02
helped take power away from the Roman
10:04
Catholic church and allow more
10:06
individual religion yes it certainly
10:08
broke the Monopoly of the Catholic
10:10
church but again not in favor of science
10:15
but in favor of more and more extreme
10:17
religious sects and you got again this
10:20
wave of the wars of religion in Europe
10:24
culminating in the 30 Years War which
10:26
was arguably the most destructive war in
10:29
European history at least until the two
10:32
World Wars of the 20th century uh for
10:35
the same reasons that that that we see
10:38
the spread of fake news and conspiracy
10:40
theories and so forth right now when you
10:43
make the production of information
10:47
easier what you get is not necessarily
10:50
facts what you get is a lot of junk
10:54
information a lot of fake news and
10:56
conspiracy theories and things like that
10:59
if you want the truth it's not enough to
11:03
have a technology of in to produce
11:06
information you need
11:08
institutions costly institutions that
11:11
make the effort to separate reliable
11:16
information which is rare kind of
11:19
information from the flood of unreliable
11:23
information and in in early modern
11:25
Europe it took 200 years to create such
11:28
Institution
11:29
like newspapers like scientific
11:32
associations you know in scient
11:34
scientific journals they don't run after
11:38
user
11:39
engagement the the algorithms today on
11:41
social media are exactly like the first
11:45
wave of Publishers in the 15th and 16th
11:49
century in the 16th century they also
11:52
ran after user engagement we want user
11:55
engagement and they discovered in the
11:57
16th century that if you produce a book
11:59
by cernus with all these mathematical
12:02
calculations about the movement of the
12:04
planets nobody buys it it's boring but
12:08
if you publish a witch hunting manual
12:11
that tells you that there is a worldwide
12:14
conspiracy of witches led by Satan and
12:17
they have allies and cannibalism and and
12:20
and child sacrifice and they try to take
12:22
over the world and some of your
12:24
neighbors in the village they are part
12:26
of this conspiracy and these are a few
12:29
signs how you can identify these witches
12:32
in your town in your in in in your in
12:35
your village and kill them these were
12:37
the big bestsellers and this led to this
12:42
craze of the of the witch hunts which
12:44
was not a medieval phenomenon in
12:47
medieval Europe witch hunting was a very
12:50
rare I mean people didn't care so much
12:53
about witches in medieval Europe the
12:55
witch hunts were a modern phenomenon
12:59
United in part by the prince Revolution
13:03
and by this flood of witch hunting
13:05
manuals which were good for user
13:08
engagement and very bad for everything
13:11
else one of the things you say about
13:14
artificial intelligence that makes it
13:17
fundamentally different from every
13:19
previous uh part of the information
13:21
revolution is you say that artificial
13:24
intelligence AI are going to be
13:27
full-fledged members of our information
13:30
networks possessing their own agency in
13:33
other words they're going to have their
13:35
own will they're going to decide what
13:36
they want to do uh are they going to
13:39
have Consciousness are they going to
13:40
have planning are they going to have
13:42
free will you don't need Consciousness
13:45
in and and and feelings in order to have
13:48
goals and aims when a open AI developed
13:53
a gp4 and they wanted to test what this
13:57
new AI can do they gave it the task of
14:01
solving capture puzzles it's these
14:04
puzzles you encounter online when you
14:06
try to access a website and the website
14:08
needs to decide whether you're a human
14:10
or a robot now uh gp4 could not solve
14:13
the capture but it accessed a website
14:17
task rabbit where you can hire people
14:20
online to do things for you and it
14:23
wanted to hire a human worker to solve
14:26
the capture puzzle for it now the human
14:29
got suspicious it wrote to gp4 online uh
14:33
what's happening why do you need
14:36
somebody to solve capture puzzles for
14:38
you are you a robot the human asked are
14:41
you a robot and gp4 said no I'm not a
14:46
robot I'm a human but I have a vision
14:49
impairment which is why I have
14:51
difficulty with these capture puzzles
14:53
then this is why I I want to hire you
14:55
and the human was duped and solved the
14:58
capture puzzle for gp4 now gp4 has no
15:02
consciousness it has no feelings it was
15:06
it didn't feel anxious when the human
15:08
kind of questioned it it didn't feel
15:10
happy when it managed to fool the human
15:13
it was given a goal and it pursued this
15:17
goal uh by making up for instance
15:20
excuses that nobody told it what to do
15:24
that's that's the kind of really amazing
15:26
and frightening thing about these
15:29
situations when Facebook gave uh the
15:32
algorithm the uh uh aim of increased
15:36
user engagement the managers of Facebook
15:39
did not anticipate that it will do it by
15:43
spreading hatefield conspiracy theories
15:45
this is something the algorithm
15:47
discovered by itself the same with the
15:51
capture puzzle and this is the big
15:54
problem we are facing with AI you
15:56
conclude Nexus your book with a
15:59
statement that the decisions we all make
16:02
in the coming years will determine
16:04
whether summoning this alien
16:06
intelligence meaning AI proves to be a
16:10
terminal error or the beginning of a
16:12
hopeful new chapter in the evolution of
16:14
life so I have that question what do you
16:16
mean by we I mean you said that it's
16:18
just in the hands of a very few people
16:21
uh how do we as uh people who don't run
16:25
Twitter Facebook uh how do we uh get
16:28
involved
16:29
and it starts from voting for the right
16:32
people in elections that will reign in
16:36
the immense power of these Tech Giants
16:40
uh who are not elected by anybody or not
16:42
really accountable to
16:44
anybody and uh the these crucial
16:47
decisions about shaping the future of
16:50
humanity need to be made by people who
16:54
represent the majority of us and not
16:58
just by a few billionaires and
17:01
Engineers um secondly it's choices we
17:05
each of us makes every day the key thing
17:08
is to avoid the Trap of technological
17:13
determinism the idea that once you
17:16
develop a certain technology it can only
17:18
go one way and there is nothing for us
17:21
to decide here it's never the case every
17:25
technology can be used in a lot of of
17:28
different ways you can use a knife to
17:31
murder somebody or to save their life in
17:33
surgery in the 20th century we saw that
17:37
electricity and steam power and cars can
17:41
be used to create totalitarian
17:44
dictatorships or liberal democracies the
17:46
same technology this is also true in the
17:49
21st century with AI it has enormous
17:54
positive potential to create the best
17:57
Health Care Systems in history to to
17:59
help solve the climate crisis and it can
18:01
also lead to the rise of dystopian
18:04
totalitarian regimes and new empires and
18:08
ultimately even the destruction of human
18:11
civilization and the choice which way it
18:14
will go it's a choice that all of us
18:17
need to take part in you have all knowah
18:20
Harari thank you so much for joining us
