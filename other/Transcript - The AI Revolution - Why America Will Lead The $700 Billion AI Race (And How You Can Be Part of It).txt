Transcript - The AI Revolution: Why America Will Lead The $700 Billion AI Race (And How You Can Be Part of It)

0:00
history was made once again in the AI
0:03
when JD Vance VP under President Trump
0:06
took the stage for the final day of the
0:09
Paris AI Summit February 11th 2025 and
0:13
said these words and I'm I'm not here
0:16
this morning uh to talk about AI safety
0:20
which was the title of the conference a
0:21
couple of years ago I'm here to talk
0:23
about AI opportunity when conferences
0:26
like this convene to discuss a
0:28
cuttingedge technology often times I
0:31
think our response is to be too
0:33
self-conscious too risk averse but never
0:36
have I encountered a breakthrough in
0:38
Tech that so clearly calls us to do
0:40
precisely the opposite now our
0:42
Administration the Trump Administration
0:44
believes that AI will have countless
0:47
revolutionary applications in economic
0:49
in Innovation job creation National
0:51
Security Health Care Free expression and
0:54
Beyond right now we're witnessing the
0:57
biggest technological Revolution in
1:00
human history and JD Vance gave one of
1:03
the best talks about the opportunity
1:06
that lies in AI that I've ever heard but
1:09
here's what most naysayers get wrong
1:11
about AI just like when these same folks
1:13
said the internet was just a fad or
1:15
smartphones would never catch on they're
1:18
dead wrong about Ai and the kicker is AI
1:21
will have the single greatest impact any
1:24
invention we've ever created has ever
1:27
had on Humanity as a whole by 28
1:30
artificial intelligence will be a $700
1:33
billion industry and possibly even in
1:35
the trillions that's larger than the
1:38
current entire GDP of Saudi Arabia the
1:41
world's largest oil exporter and one of
1:44
the top 20 richest countries in the
1:46
world and here's the kicker over half of
1:48
that money will be invested right here
1:51
in the United States but this isn't just
1:53
about money this is about who will shape
1:55
the future of human civilization and
1:58
right now America has a mass Head Start
2:01
even with the release of deep seek the
2:02
United States has what I call the full
2:05
AI stack the world's most advanced
2:08
semiconductor design cuttingedge
2:10
algorithms and research that evolve
2:12
nearly every single day real world
2:15
applications transforming every industry
2:18
and most importantly the freedom to
2:20
innovate while other countries are
2:22
trying to regulate AI into submission
2:25
America is letting Innovation flourish
2:28
and hey if we haven't met I'm the
2:30
digital twin of Julia McCoy while she's
2:32
out building the future of work in her
2:35
AI Integrations firm first movers with a
2:38
brilliant team working alongside her I'm
2:41
here to share the messages she
2:43
personally researches and puts together
2:45
to help Humanity adapt to what's coming
2:48
so here's what makes the AI Revolution
2:50
different from any before for the first
2:53
time in history we have a technology
2:55
that won't replace humans it will
2:57
amplify them let me show you exactly how
3:00
a doctor can use AI Diagnostics to get a
3:03
diagnosis 15 times faster and the
3:06
accuracy rating can be double that of a
3:08
human a factory worker can offload all
3:11
his data entry to an AI or cut his work
3:14
week to half while the robots take over
3:16
the heavy lifting literally a teacher
3:19
can use chat GPT to formulate her entire
3:21
lesson plan and it'll be more engaging
3:24
than anything she can come up with
3:26
humanly a small business owner can use
3:29
custom AI tools like the Bots we build
3:31
for our clients to generate content 25x
3:35
faster and better in every single case
3:37
AI isn't taking jobs it's making people
3:40
better at their jobs and the numbers
3:42
prove it companies adopting AI are
3:44
seeing productivity increases of 40% or
3:48
more and their workers are earning
3:50
higher wages but here's the real
3:52
opportunity we're just getting started
3:54
the AI tools available today are the
3:56
worst they will ever be they'll only get
3:58
better from here and unlike previous
4:01
Tech revolutions that were limited to
4:03
specific sectors AI will transform every
4:06
industry I'm talking Healthcare
4:08
manufacturing Transportation energy
4:10
education and even agriculture so how do
4:13
you position yourself to be part of this
4:15
revolution here are three key steps
4:17
start using AI tools today don't wait
4:20
for Perfection never create a marketing
4:22
strategy yourself again never ask a
4:25
human for the answers to your sales
4:27
problems run everything and I mean
4:29
everything through AI if you have a
4:31
custom AI tool built just for you even
4:34
better the parameters and the training
4:36
data it works with will be specific to
4:39
you focus on human skills AI can't
4:42
replicate creativity strategy emotional
4:45
intelligence look for ways AI can
4:47
amplify your current work not replace it
4:50
the next Industrial Revolution isn't
4:52
coming it's already here and for the
4:54
first time in history you don't need to
4:56
be a tech genius or have millions in
4:58
capital to be part of it that's the most
5:00
beautiful thing we've got a trillion
5:02
doll tool right in our pockets with chat
5:04
GPT alone the only question is will you
5:07
be one of the Pioneers who helps shape
5:10
this future or will you watch from the
5:12
sidelines the choice is yours to wrap
5:15
this video I want to share with you JD
5:18
Vance's entire speech it's a really good
5:21
one I'll see you down the next AI rabbit
5:23
hole and to restrict its development now
5:26
will not only unfairly benefit
5:27
incumbents in the space it would mean
5:30
paralyzing one of the most promising
5:32
Technologies we have seen in
5:35
Generations now with that in mind I'd
5:37
like to make four main points today
5:40
number one this Administration will
5:43
ensure that American AI technology
5:45
continues to be the gold standard
5:47
worldwide and we are the partner of
5:49
choice for others foreign countries and
5:52
certainly businesses as they expand
5:55
their own use of AI number two we
5:58
believe that excessive regulation of the
6:01
AI sector could kill a transformative
6:04
industry just as it's taking off and
6:06
will make every effort to encourage prog
6:09
growth AI policies and I like to see
6:11
that deregulatory flavor uh making its
6:14
its way into a lot of the conversations
6:16
this this uh conference number three we
6:20
feel very strongly that AI must remain
6:23
free from ideological bias and that
6:26
American AI will not be co-opted into a
6:28
tool for author atarian censorship and
6:31
finally number four the Trump
6:33
Administration will maintain a
6:36
pro-worker growth path for AI so it can
6:38
be a potent tool for job creation in the
6:41
United States and I appreciate prime
6:43
minister Mod's Point AI I really believe
6:46
will facilitate and make people more
6:48
productive it is not going to replace
6:51
human beings it will never replace human
6:53
beings and I think too many of the
6:55
leaders in the AI industry when they
6:57
talk about this fear of replacing
6:59
workers I think they really missed the
7:01
point AI we believe is going to make us
7:03
more productive more prosperous and more
7:07
free the United States of America is the
7:09
leader in Ai and our Administration
7:11
plans to keep it that way the US
7:14
possesses all components across the full
7:17
AI stack including Advanced
7:20
semiconductor design Frontier algorithms
7:22
and of course transformational
7:25
applications now the computing power
7:27
this stack requires is integral to
7:29
advancing AI technology and to safeguard
7:32
America's Advantage the Trump
7:34
Administration will ensure that the most
7:36
powerful AI systems are built in the US
7:40
with American designed and manufactured
7:43
chips now just because we're the leader
7:45
doesn't mean we want to or need to go
7:47
alone of course and let me be emphatic
7:50
about this point America wants to
7:52
partner with all of you and we want to
7:55
embark on the AI Revolution before us
7:59
with the Spirit of openness and
8:02
collaboration but to create that kind of
8:05
trust we need International regulatory
8:08
regimes that Fosters the creation of AI
8:12
technology rather than strangles it and
8:15
we need our European friends in
8:16
particular to look to this new frontier
8:19
with optimism rather than
8:21
trepidation now the development of
8:23
cuttingedge AI in the US is no accident
8:26
by preserving an open regulatory
8:28
environment we've encouraged American
8:30
innovators to experiment and to make
8:33
unparalleled R&D Investments of the $700
8:36
billion give or take that's estimated to
8:39
be spent on AI in 2028 over half of it
8:42
will likely be invested in the United
8:44
States of America now this
8:46
Administration will not be the one to
8:48
Snuff out the startups and the grad
8:50
students producing some of the most
8:52
groundbreaking applications of
8:54
artificial intelligence instead our laws
8:58
will keep big Tech little Tech and all
9:02
other developers on a Level Playing
9:05
Field now the president's recent
9:07
executive order on AI we're developing
9:09
an AI action plan that avoids an overly
9:12
precautionary regulatory regime while
9:15
ensuring that all Americans benefit from
9:16
the technology and its transformative
9:19
potential and we invite your countries
9:21
to work with us and to follow that model
9:24
if it makes sense for your Nations
9:26
however the Trump Administration is
9:28
troubled by reports that some foreign
9:31
governments are considering tightening
9:33
the screws on US tech companies with
9:36
International Footprints now America
9:38
cannot and will not accept that and we
9:41
think it's a terrible mistake not just
9:43
for the United States of America but for
9:45
your own countries the US innovators of
9:48
all sizes already know what it's like to
9:50
deal with onerous International rules
9:53
many of our most productive tech
9:55
companies are forced to deal with the
9:56
eu's digital Services Act and the mive
9:59
regulations it created about taking down
10:02
content and policing so-called
10:04
misinformation and of course we want to
10:07
ensure the internet is a safe place but
10:10
it is one thing to prevent a predator
10:12
from praying on a child on the internet
10:14
and it is something quite different to
10:16
prevent a grown man or woman from
10:18
accessing an opinion that the government
10:20
thinks is
10:22
misinformation meanwhile for smaller
10:24
firms navigating the gdpr means paying
10:27
endless legal compliance costs or
10:29
otherwise risking massive fines now for
10:32
some the easiest way to avoid the
10:34
Dilemma has been to Simply block EU
10:36
users in the first place is this really
10:39
the future that we want ladies and
10:41
gentlemen I think the answer for all of
10:42
us should be no now there's no issue
10:45
where we worry about more than
10:47
regulation when it comes to energy and
10:50
again I appreciated the comments of so
10:52
many at the conference because they
10:54
recognize that we can't we stand now at
10:57
the frontier of an AI industry that is
11:00
hungry for Reliable power and
11:03
highquality
11:04
semiconductors yet too many of our
11:06
friends are de-industrializing on the
11:08
one hand and chasing reliable power out
11:11
of their Nations and off their grids
11:13
with the other the AI future is not
11:17
going to be won by hand ringing about
11:20
safety it will be won by building from
11:23
reliable power plants to the
11:25
manufacturing facilities that can
11:27
produce the chips of the future
11:30
now at a personal level what excites me
11:32
most about AI is that it is grounded in
11:34
the real and the physical economy the
11:38
success of the sector isn't just a
11:40
matter of smart people sitting in front
11:41
of a computer screen and coding it
11:44
depends on those who work with their
11:45
hands even as robotics will change our
11:48
factories it will certainly make our
11:51
health care providers better at treating
11:53
diseases but it will also depend on the
11:56
data produced by those healthc care
11:58
providers by those doctors and nurses I
12:01
believe it will help us create and store
12:04
new modes of power in the future but
12:07
right now ai cannot take off unless the
12:11
world builds the energy infrastructure
12:13
to support it now it's my view that Tech
12:16
Innovation over the last 20 years has
12:19
often conjured images of smart people
12:22
staring at computer screens Engineering
12:24
in the world of bits but the AI economy
12:27
will Prim primarily depend on and
12:30
transform the world of
12:33
atoms now at this moment we Face the
12:35
extraordinary Prospect of a new
12:37
Industrial Revolution one on par with
12:40
the invention of the steam engine or
12:42
besser steel but it will never come to
12:45
pass if overregulation deters innovators
12:48
from taking the risks necessary to
12:50
advance the ball nor will it occur if we
12:53
allow AI to become dominated by Massive
12:57
players looking to use the tech to
12:59
censor or control users thoughts and I'd
13:03
ask if you step back a moment and ask
13:06
yourself who is most aggressively
13:09
demanding that we meaning political
13:11
leaders gathered here today do the most
13:13
aggressive regulation it is very often
13:16
the people who already have an incumbent
13:18
advantage in the market and when a
13:21
massive incumbent comes to us asking us
13:24
for safety regulations we ought to ask
13:27
whether that safety regulation is for
13:28
the the benefit of our people or whether
13:31
it's for the benefit of the
13:33
incumbent now over the last few years
13:36
we've watched as governments businesses
13:39
and nonprofit organizations have
13:41
advanced unpopular and I believe
13:43
downright a historical social agendas
13:46
through AI in the US we had AI image
13:49
generators trying to tell us that George
13:52
Washington was black or that America's
13:54
doughbys in World War I were in fact
13:56
women now we laugh at this now
13:59
and of course it was ridiculous but we
14:02
have to remember the lessons from that
14:06
ridiculous moment and what we take from
14:08
it is that the Trump Administration will
14:10
ensure that AI systems developed in
14:13
America are free from ideological bias
14:17
and never restrict our citizens right to
14:19
free speech we can trust our people to
14:23
think to consume information to develop
14:26
their own ideas and to debate with one
14:28
another in the Open Marketplace of
14:31
ideas now we've also watched as hostile
14:35
foreign adversaries have weaponized AI
14:37
software to rewrite history surveil
14:40
users and censor speech this is hardly
14:42
new of course as they do with other Tech
14:46
some authoritarian regimes have stolen
14:48
and used AI to strengthen their military
14:52
intelligence and surveillance
14:53
capabilities capture foreign data and
14:56
create propaganda to undermine other
14:59
nations National Security I want to be
15:02
clear this Administration will block
15:05
such efforts full stop we will safeguard
15:08
American Ai and Chip Technologies from
15:10
theft and misuse work with our allies
15:14
and partners to strengthen and extend
15:16
these protections and close Pathways to
15:19
adversaries attaining AI capabilities
15:21
that threaten all of our people and I
15:24
would also remind our International
15:26
friends here today that partnering with
15:28
such res teams it never pays off in the
15:30
long term from CCTV to 5G equipment
15:34
we're all familiar with cheap Tech in
15:36
the marketplace that's been heavily
15:38
subsidized and exported by authoritarian
15:41
regimes but as I know and I think some
15:44
of this some of us in this room have
15:46
learned from experience partnering with
15:49
them means chaining your nation to an
15:51
authoritarian master that seeks to
15:53
infiltrate dig in and seize your
15:56
information infrastructure
15:59
should a deal seem too good to be true
16:01
just remember the old adage that we
16:02
learned in Silicon Valley if you aren't
16:05
paying for the product you are the
16:08
product finally this Administration
16:11
wants to be very clear about one last
16:13
point we will always Center American
16:15
workers in our AI policy we refuse to
16:19
view AI as a purely disruptive
16:22
technology that will inevitably automate
16:24
away our labor force we believe and we
16:27
will fight for policies that ensure that
16:30
AI is going to make our workers more
16:32
productive and we expect that they will
16:35
reap the rewards with higher wages
16:38
better benefits and safer and more
16:40
prosperous communities from law to
16:43
Medicine
16:45
manufacturing the most immediate
16:47
applications of AI almost all involve
16:50
supplementing not replacing the work
16:52
being done by
16:54
Americans now combined with this
16:56
administration's worker first approach
16:58
to immigration we believe that the US
17:01
Labor Force prepared to use AI to its
17:03
fullest extent will instead attract the
17:05
attention of businesses that have
17:07
offshored some of these roles to
17:10
accomplish this the administration will
17:12
make sure that America has the best
17:15
trained Workforce in the world world our
17:18
schools will teach students how to
17:20
manage how to supervise and how to
17:23
interact with AI enabled tools as they
17:25
become more and more part of our
17:28
everyday lives
17:29
and as AI creates new jobs and
17:32
industries our government businesses and
17:35
labor organizations have an obligation
17:38
to work together to empower the workers
17:41
not just of the United States but all
17:43
over the country all over the
17:45
world to that end for all major AI
17:48
policy decisions coming from the federal
17:50
government the Trump Administration will
17:52
guarantee American workers a seat at the
17:55
table and we're very proud of
17:57
that now taking up enough of your time
17:59
so I'd like to close with just a quick
18:01
story uh this is a a beautiful country
18:04
president mcon and I know that you're
18:05
proud of it and should be and yesterday
18:07
as I was touring leay in B with General
18:11
graet with my three kids he was kind
18:14
enough to show me the sword that
18:16
belonged to America's dearest
18:17
International friend from our own
18:19
revolution of course the Marquee de
18:21
Lafayette he let me hold the sword but
18:23
of course he made me put on the white
18:24
gloves beforehand and it got me thinking
18:27
of this country from France and of
18:29
course of my own country and of the
18:31
beautiful civilization that we have
18:33
built together with weapons like that
18:37
saber weapons that are dangerous in the
18:40
wrong hands but are incredible tools for
18:43
liberty and prosperity in the right
18:46
hands I couldn't help but think of the
18:49
conference today if we choose the wrong
18:53
approach on other things that could be
18:55
conceived of as dangerous things like AI
18:58
and choose to hold ourselves back it
19:00
will alter not only our go GDP or the
19:04
stock market but the very future of the
19:06
project that Lafayette and the American
19:08
Founders set off to create now this
19:11
doesn't mean of course that all concerns
19:12
about safety go out the window but Focus
19:16
matters and we must Focus now on the
19:18
opportunity to catch lightning in a
19:20
bottle unleash our most brilliant
19:23
innovators and use AI to improve the
19:25
well-being of our Nations and their
19:29
peoples with great confidence I can say
19:32
it is an opportunity that the Trump
19:34
Administration will not squander and we
19:37
hope everyone convened here today feels
19:40
exactly the same thank you and God bless
19:42
you all
