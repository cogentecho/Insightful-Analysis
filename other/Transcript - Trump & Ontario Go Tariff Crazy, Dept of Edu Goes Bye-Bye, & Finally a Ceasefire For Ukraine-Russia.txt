hey everybody we're here we're here we are live yes sir all right what's up
4:00
everybody Welcome to the Tom Bilu show I'm excited to have you we're going to be trying something a little bit different today uh on Friday we actually
4:09
ran the episode call it 40% as if the live were actually the episode Drew you
4:15
want to confirm those percentages yeah about that we are actually we're gonna
4:21
we're gonna try running this um as the episode so you guys will be with us the whole time we're not going to break uh
4:28
stop down for me to write an an intro and then do a whole thing we're just going to do the episode uh and then
4:33
we'll do a cut down of what we do live with you guys so more than ever boys and girls your contributions are going to
4:39
matter here as we cover all the things that we need to cover so there is a lot
4:44
on the docket today Jesus uh I've been traveling so um we've got a lot of pent
4:51
up stuff here so it'll be very very interesting I think today so first of all chat welcome thank you for being
4:57
here straw hat Amanda zenergy it is wonderful to see everybody zenergy says
5:04
Trump's plan is working brilliantly it's melting the money makers and it's coming
5:09
down to us melting the money makers I don't know what that means it is
5:15
certainly battering the stock market that is for sure and now Mark says Trump
5:22
is failing no surprise this is fascinating we had a comment the other day that said I love that you guys
5:27
divide the right now needless to say was traumatized uh to be put in any kind of bucket but yeah I think that you just
5:36
had we just had a whole long discussion there's no teams we're looking at this objectively and yet I don't so here's
5:43
the thing I don't think it is possible for the human mind at scale when you start looking at
5:51
the broad world I don't think it is possible to break that organizational structure
5:58
so a especially when you put in the incentives of to build a successful
6:04
YouTube channel people have to understand what you are and unless we can make a centr stance an actual tribe
6:13
that people care about we will flounder so it's very interesting to watch this I
6:19
think about this a lot when Destiny um comments on us which he did again I don't know if you saw that saw that so
6:24
we'll definitely want what's up G uh we will definitely want to play that clip
6:30
um but he's somebody that I think does a very good job of making his community
6:36
feel like they have a location on the Spectrum and so it feels tribey he's
6:42
very big he's very theatrical like he's got um a very aggressive plag flag
6:50
planted um so it'll be interesting to see if there is a scalable community in
6:56
the way that I approach the world I actually don't know the answer to that so we will find out Drew we will find
7:02
out but I think about that a lot uh and I also think about okay do I start Kay fabing it do I play a characterized
7:10
version of myself I reserve the right I'm not gonna lie uh but I as of right
7:16
now I don't know how I both respect myself and play a version of myself that doesn't feel real I don't know we'll see
7:23
uh but that's where we're at boys and girls so it is wonderful to have you g Paul what is up as a reminder everybody super chats will come in the second hour
7:30
so for now if you want to interrupt the flow uh you've got to cross that $20
7:35
barrier so $20 and up will get you Super Chat red light turned on we'll talk about it right now otherwise we will
7:40
save them for hour two uh and then we will go into it and any amount of Super
7:46
Chat in hour two will be addressed in the order of the amount uh given or paid
7:52
or donated I don't know what they're what they're considered Eric I slacked you the first three videos if we can cue those up or G Paul you should have
7:59
doubled them up and done them at once but yeah we'll get to those in the second hour what were you about to say
8:05
no Eric uh if we could pull up those first three uh videos from slack do so while you were in Vegas by the way how
8:11
was your trip well now that you're asking on camera I'll actually give you the real answer so uh there is a really
8:17
interesting company that wanted me to come join them at an AI event called
8:22
Alani nice if what they say they actually do it's interesting
8:30
um so the way that they pitch it admittedly this took a lot of questions
8:35
to get the answer out of them so I'm not entirely sure if where the rubber meets the road is actually going to do this
8:41
thing um but it goes like this right now an llm is trained on the world the whole
8:48
world and so the big gap is everybody wants something trained on their company
8:53
yeah and that's what they do so they will take the Leverage The ability to
9:00
decipher information from a large llm but then anchor it around just your data
9:06
with 100% accuracy meaning that their system will say this is where we got this answer and so let's say that
9:13
there's four references in their answer you can click it and then it'll pull up in our case it's so far they have
9:19
trained it as like a demo to show us that it works they've trained it on all of my itu classes and so if it says uh Tom billu
9:27
believes this about starting a business it will give you the reference you click it it'll take you to the timestamp where
9:32
I said it so that is pretty impressive you can turn your whole company into a knowledge base that rides on top of an
9:39
llm uh so that is very interesting I like that um and that it's very easy to
9:48
update so you could go in and say no I don't believe that anymore now I believe this and you give it a new document you say this new document is the piece of
9:54
Truth okay so if they can do that well that's very interesting now needless to say where I started getting really
10:01
excited was I was like can I do that for a given let's say for project Kaizen can
10:06
I create a um instead of building it around the company as a whole can I say
10:12
these are the things that are true about project Kaizen yes okay that's interesting could I do it from a
10:17
character's perspective so instead of telling you all the things that I believe are true could somebody come in and interact with one of our characters
10:24
yes you could do that and I was like okay well now this is starting to get very interesting um as we covered in our
10:30
last episode which of course people were clowning on me for you're going to have a relationship with your refrigerator
10:36
you're going to have a relationship with your lamp you're gonna have a relationship with your chair and for some people that strikes them as
10:41
ridiculous for me that is very exciting and for you to be able to imbue
10:49
your chair with a specific personality where you can go in and cultivate it
10:54
build it give it a backstory history all of that stuff W that gets very interesting and so uh Alani claims that
11:01
they have patents on this stuff and so if they really do and they become the method by which we imbue things with
11:08
intelligence now I'm stretching they would never pitch their thing as doing this um but that's where I come out in
11:16
terms of how I'd want to use it so anyway that was cool but then walking around the show I realized that AI is
11:23
really still in its infancy in terms of how people are going to use it and so you walk around to all the different
11:28
booths and you're like what do you do so uh we are in a weird position all right
11:34
Preston is like I gotta I got to say this right now by the way we have not
11:39
introduced the community to will everybody this is will will is playing
11:45
the Unice role today we are very excited to have him will actually runs impact Theory University he looks like he's
11:51
nine but I assure you this kid is sharp so here he is Will got nine years at
11:56
impact Theory you have to say what I got n years at impact Theory that's true he's been with us since he was 17 which
12:02
is crazy town absolutely crazy so William good to be here say more all
12:08
right so Preston has a video that he wants to share with us I'm looking for the link in the Discord but uh he has an
12:15
wants to advocate for his solution to AI economy in the short video but I'll find that video and I'll send that to Eric
12:21
all right I would like to try again to advocate for my solution to an AI economy in this short video so I'm going
12:26
to guess this is him but I can't find the video in the Discord uh oh in the
12:33
discordian link to follow in dis or in Discord hopefully it
12:39
follows we'll see all right well when it comes in we will take a look and then there's another person back to back not
12:45
a theory not a theory any opinion on the White House advertising for Tesla thanks
12:51
for helping me keep an open mind and motivated Soul wow jump open mind and motivated Soul uh I need to put that on
12:58
a t-shirt is that pretty accurately sums up what I would love to bring to the
13:03
world okay so when I look at that if you abstract
13:11
it out to we have we have I I think it is pretty
13:18
compelling to call it domestic terrorism uh I would much rather be against a company other than Tesla and
13:25
so thankfully meaning that Elon is so in the government right now I think that
13:32
they're um you're giving people a lot of ammunition to say that this is impropriety I get that at the same time
13:39
you've got people defacing Teslas which are not owned by Elon Musk for the love of God so you're defacing an individual
13:47
Citizen's property that's crazy to me you've got him uh you've got people
13:53
shooting up Tesla dealerships you've got people throwing Molotov cocktails at Tesla dealerships that is domestic
13:59
terrorism so horrible but that has to be universally seen you can't say oh it's
14:07
only like that when it's a Tesla dealership now I heard Trump say himself Tesla or any other company so uh if as
14:15
long as that's the energy I'm here for it but you cannot have people firebombing buildings that they don't like uh take abortion clinics you can't
14:22
have people doing that can't have people shooting people that go to abortion clinics cannot have people burning them down which they do uh so that kind of
14:31
stuff can't have it whether it's a Tesla dealership an abortion clinic anybody else um if you
14:39
are witnessing an industry or a company under attack and you want to as the
14:45
president get the energy moving in a different direction I'm here for it so I don't have any beef with that um but
14:51
again I wish that it were any other company other than Tesla and Elon Musk
14:57
but that guy is paying an extraord ordinary price for getting involved in government and this is where I really
15:05
have a hard time mapping what people think about Elon he makes sense to me in
15:11
one of two ways he makes sense in either he is actually a patriotic person who
15:18
really believes freedom of speech is important which is why he buys x uh that he really believes that um we were this
15:26
is going to the Dow that can be spoken is not the Eternal da so to say that he got into it just to make sure that we
15:32
didn't lose um we didn't become a one- party country MH it's never going to be
15:38
that clean but to oversimplify it uh that he really believed that he that
15:43
President Trump had to get elected that we were in a position where unchecked immigration was creating a problem uh
15:50
not the least of which was bringing in people that have a higher propensity to vote Democrat and so you could swing
15:57
things I mean this is uh at a headline reading analysis exactly what happened in California and living in California I
16:04
really don't want a one party country a one party state is terrible enough uh so
16:09
he makes sense to me when you think of him like that somebody who really believed that they were saving democracy okay he also makes sense if he is like
16:18
so smart that he's a 4D chess guy and on a long enough timeline he can get governmental capture uh and so getting
16:25
in bed with the sitting president and saying I heard this really interesting quote that if you're not at the table
16:31
you're on the menu he makes sense if he's doing that so either of those interpretations make
16:37
me go oh yeah there's High predictive validity either way you look at him so
16:43
which one of those two ends up being true it probably is a blend because he
16:49
is getting hammered in the short term for his beliefs and if there wasn't any sort of patriotic thing here I think it
16:56
would be nonsensical this is like when I heard people I actually heard people that I know and respect say things like
17:04
I bet Trump had somebody shoot at him just to go up in popularity and I was
17:10
like hold on you think he paid somebody to graze his ear with a bullet what do
17:18
you know how likely you are to kill the man like that would be the most absurd thing in the world elon's businesses are getting
17:26
sledg hammered right now absolutely sledgehammer the amount of chaos that he has Unleashed on his businesses and his
17:32
life by getting into politics in in the way that he has like Soros has been way
17:37
smarter Go Local do it for decades as quietly as humanly possible if he were
17:44
doing that I'd be like okay that makes sense but to get involved in the way that he's gotten involved I think
17:49
unleashes an amount of chaos that if he isn't also doing it for patriotic
17:54
reasons it just didn't make any sense it's not a good look though that the president is doing a commercial for
17:59
Tesla in front of the White House though like what if it were any other company would you feel the same the fact that he
18:05
has four of the private cars lined up I mean if Tesla would have announced a massive infrastructure deal I can at
18:10
least say okay they just did that but it seemed like it was unprovoked like yes that they were attacks on the dealership
18:17
yes you can call it domestic terrorism all good have a press conference go to the podium and condemn it like condemn
18:23
the attacks but to not only condemn the attacks and then line up all the cars and then say I'm buying one they're
18:29
coming today like it's a little weird at the same time though I'm going to call out my own bias I found out that Joe
18:35
Biden just hopped into he did something for Jeep similarly in like 2001 when he announced centus deal that's the company
18:42
that owns Dodge Jeep and all those other companies he got into one of those and drove away so it's not the first time
18:48
that the president got into not only is it not the first time you see this all the time so uh you will see presidents
18:55
you will see cabinet members go and support I mean like you have um RFK at Steak and Shake yeah um after
19:04
they the beef Tallow yeah because they're doing the beef Tallow so it's one of those again I wish it were a
19:09
different company because now you've just got it's way too mixed up
19:15
in because Elon is such a close part of the government um and look I don't know
19:23
if Trump owns Tesla stock I feel way worse about it but I I don't have any
19:29
indication I haven't heard anybody squawk that Trump is doing this to enrich himself um if you're going to
19:35
call impropriety you're going to say this is exactly why Elon got involved in the government so in moments like this
19:41
they could do this kind of thing in front of the White House and I will go back to that would be the dumbest [ __ ] reason on planet Earth to get
19:48
involved in the government because the whole reason that he has to have the
19:55
president Goose his public profile is because by getting involved in the
20:00
government it has hammered his public profile if he had just stayed in the background he would have been fine he
20:05
would have continued to be a darling of the left and so it's like guys make it make sense it either he's a total
20:13
[ __ ] who thinks oh yeah just shoot me in the head but only graze my ear or he
20:21
has a blended because to say that he's doing this just out of the goodness of his heart I don't buy that but I think
20:29
it is a mix of I really believe the things that I'm saying in terms of
20:34
saving America and by having a seat at the table I understand that I can nudge
20:40
things in my direction so but to me this is this is how this stuff plays out all the time
20:46
the only thing that I will say about this era that I love it's all happening
20:51
in plain sight I think that transparency though
20:56
looks like corruption vers versus this is how it's always been so you would rather it be hidden it's not what I say
21:03
but that's where the I think the public discourse has come to that but you just said that transparency looks like
21:08
corruption so either you're saying previously there was no corruption and
21:14
therefore I was happier but transparency pulling something into the light at
21:20
least allows people to say this is trash like I can't believe they're doing this I would rather live in a world where all
21:27
of this stuff is talked about it's all blatantly out in the open and then we can drill in so for
21:33
instance um somebody made an off-handed comment in a comment that I read about the fact that Elon no longer gets
21:40
community notes and I was like hold on if that's true I care a lot about that
21:45
and so that I would want to drill into and be like okay he has made his um
21:51
algorithm publicly available so let's actually look at the algorithm and see did he make a change that you can tie
21:58
back back to this is Elon clearly trying to make it harder for people to fact check him that I would throw red flags
22:05
on the field all day every day so anyway again I don't think that you're crazy to
22:11
say I don't like this look but this is the kind of thing that the government does a lot to support American industry
22:18
or whatever initiative politically they're trying to get through all right speaking of government initiatives we
22:24
got a Super Chat let's go will Super Chat from Ricky Robbins he's interested to hearing your take but also Eric
22:31
Weinstein's take once you have him on on cutting the Department of Education spending on Special Needs program since
22:38
the system failed him he's also Rick Rob Ricky Robbins previous comments he's a
22:43
for background he's a high school teacher he's just concerned about how cutting the Department of Education is going to affect lower social economic
22:50
students and special needs okay so with the Department of Education I would say look at the
22:58
outcome of a policy this is why I'm like you have to understand uh you need to State what
23:05
your goal is you need to say what the kpi is that represents that goal and
23:11
then you say this is the thing that we're going to try to do to affect this so take the Department of Education we're trying to uh move our standing in
23:20
the global rankings okay that would be a very simple way to track this uh since
23:26
the Department of Education got came into existence we have held uh
23:32
flat or moved backwards I think there are very few places where we've actually
23:37
made very minor improvements and so given that I would say it has failed to
23:43
do its job now is getting rid of it the answer or do you have to go in and make
23:48
adjustments that I will say we're about to find out because they're I think they're going to try to abolish it so
23:55
50% is already cut really yeah they emails last night that by Tuesday morning they have to have their Tuesday
24:01
evening they have to have their stuff packed up uh what did they use as the
24:07
method of determining what 50% to cut o that's a thing that we need to go deeper on yeah so that'll be interesting but I
24:13
if you if we can't agree that as of today the Department of Education has failed to achieve its goals now we're in
24:20
trouble but if we can agree that the Department of Education has failed to achieve its goals then it's like okay
24:26
what changes do we need to make in order to get the outcomes that we want now I think a lot of people believe that the
24:33
Department of Education is going to be cut and then it's just like well good luck um all of the things that are being
24:38
done are shifting off to other departments um I've heard a breakdown I
24:43
don't have it memorized but we'd have to look it up but it's like things are going to be shifted over into different departments to make sure that um for
24:52
instance I think the Department of Justice is going to handle whether um
24:57
different communities are being treated differently so like Racial equality that's going to go through the Department of Justice so the things that
25:05
we want the Department of Education to do will be handed off to different
25:10
institutions it's right now self-evident to me that we are not
25:16
achieving our goals and therefore we have to do something different so the definition of insanity is to do the same
25:21
thing and expect a different outcome now what Eric Weinstein thinks about this I have no idea I've not heard him talk
25:27
about it so if somebody wants to pull up a tweet that he's done although he does
25:32
tend on the long side of tweets so it might have to review for the next one um
25:38
but I'd be very interested to know how they determined what 50% to uh Slash
25:46
because if they're doing that poorly then you're not going to get any positive outcome from all of
25:54
this and there it is and there it is um pulling up right now the focus is to
26:00
reallocate the resources to the students parents and the teachers and cutting
26:05
some of these extra programs it's similar to the Dei rollback that been doing across the government um that
26:12
still feels vague what does that mean what do you know does it list what programs were actually cut it's just
26:18
that the staff of 4100 is going to be cut in half and that's with layoffs in the buyouts that they did earlier in his
26:24
administration got it so if it follows that then it's basically who are the people that will voluntarily go yeah um
26:33
who are the newest people hired so it's a blunt instrument I don't expect that to yield fantastic results it will lower
26:40
the cost of the Department of Education that is not going to automatically increase the output of the Department of
26:46
Education meaning that we move up in stature and language and Mathematics and
26:51
all of that stuff um so that makes me very sad now when I'm advising business
26:58
owners I always say is there somebody that has done this well before if it is go audit them figure out what they did
27:05
um I always round everything to Kip schools and so forgive me if it isn't specifically kip but there are charter
27:11
schools that are absolutely crushing it and so looking at the um Charter Schools
27:17
I think it' be a very good way I will shorthand what I have learned at my um
27:23
surface enough level of analysis uh but it goes something like this you have to hold kids accountable
27:30
to a very aggressive standard you have to set expectations so from the moment
27:36
they come into a school uh charter school students are told you are going to college you are going to graduate um
27:44
and they have teachers that are held accountable to the results of the students in their class and if those
27:49
teachers are not able to deliver the results those teachers are replaced uh so you have evolutionary pressures on
27:55
the teacher you have evolutionary pressures on the students uh you set the expectation you hold people accountable to a high standard
28:02
we've really gotten um into a weird place in America where we think that holding a kid to a standard is mean
28:08
because not all kids are going to be able to make the standard but that that's just the reality so for instance
28:14
I was unable to get into the advanced program when I was in Middle School I
28:20
managed to pull it off when I got into high school but I wasn't able to do it in middle school was that mean I would say not if I wasn't ready for it I
28:26
wasn't ready for it and that's just that so um it put me in a position where I
28:32
wanted to work harder so that I could do better now unfortunately the way that that all plays out in my psychology was
28:38
absolutely terrible because I just end up cheating like a fiend in high school uh I learned my lesson by the
28:43
time I got to college boys and girls but nonetheless uh putting those kinds of
28:49
expectations on people allows for all of us to step back and say who's hitting the standard who's not
28:57
remembering that skills have utility so if you can do that thing it means you're actually capable in the real world of
29:02
something that other people are not and then um that will give us a much clearer
29:08
sense of how we get the output that we want
29:14
and right now by lowering standards lowering standards lowering standards we have an invisible goal of I just want
29:20
kids to feel good period Now new paragraph
29:30
I don't think that I think that it is deeply embedded in the human psyche that
29:37
if our praise is contingent on somebody protecting us from the reality that we
29:44
are not good at something there's an internal feeling of unease and I think a
29:50
big part of anxiety comes from uh knowing that you need somebody else to
29:56
defend you that you're not able to defend your own position and so when you're getting that trophy for uh
30:02
participation that some part of you knows I'm not as good as the other people and I know that and so uh let's
30:08
just take basketball as something that I'm just unbelievably bad at when I was playing basketball as a
30:15
freshman I did not understand that if I practiced I would get better so every
30:21
time I went out on the court it felt like an indictment of who I was as a person and nobody was able to pierce my
30:27
frame of reference to get me to understand that if I practiced I could get better and since I could get better
30:32
I needed to be held accountable to every time I stepped on the court that I was trying to get a little bit smarter I was trying to get a little bit better and
30:38
that I should be um listening to coaches and taking the criticism as a way to
30:43
improve instead of as this indictment of myself so if somebody had stood up for me and said no no no you've got to give
30:49
this time this kid time on the court everybody deserves time on the court I would know every time I stepped in the court but I suck and so why are you
30:56
putting me in and would have this deep unease uh around that and
31:02
so I would want people to learn how to step into that Arena and say okay you
31:09
have a frame of reference that this is an indictment of you but the reality is that skills have utility and you can get good at this you may not ever be as good
31:16
as other people uh because we all have a starting we all have
31:24
biologically real our our skills are tied to to our biology call it roughly 50% cool but you can get 100 times
31:32
better at anything if that had been the frame of reference that I had then uh it
31:38
becomes a very different game than feeling like I need other people to step in on my behalf which is a very fragile place to
31:44
live period do you think that education should be
31:51
privatized you have traumatized me privatized prisons so deeply um
31:59
I think that there should be a private option that is for sure so that we can
32:04
see do private schools yield better results if they yield better results is
32:10
there anything that stops the governmental education from copying those things but education is one of the
32:16
things that my knee-jerk reaction is that should not be exclusively privatized because I want my tax dollars
32:25
going to the Next Generation like that if you
32:31
um if you want to make me feel good about my taxes take my money and make the next
32:38
generation of just assassins that's I tried to get
32:44
around that word Drew I just couldn't that that is the word that my mind BN identity the whole Next Generation yeah
32:49
I but but obviously intellect get you yeah I get you U okay so as we're as I'm going
32:56
through it I'm on a rotor's article right now I can drop the link in the Discord so the Department of Education
33:01
it does not is not the source of bulk public school funding so public school funding comes from the state and local
33:06
governments more than 85% of that comes from their local municipalities so cutting the department of education does
33:12
not mean that education the state and local schools is a automatically done it's only about 15% um also Linda McMahon who's Vince
33:20
McMahon's wife who leads the Department of Education I just find that hilarious um she said that to be honest they
33:26
cannot out cut the department without a vote from Congress so although they're slashing it down and they're reducing the size of it there's no way it could
33:33
go to zero without a Congressional vote um a majority of the department oversees student loans pel grants and special
33:41
need um funding for special need programs funds the art programs and outplay out and replaces outdated
33:48
infrastructure so the Department of Education as I'm reading it and again I'll link this they're kind of the stop
33:53
Gap to help certain schools and certain municipalities they fund certain programs on on top of the existing
33:58
School structure that's already there and they also enforce Title 9 guidelines that prohibit sex discrimination in
34:05
education word in 2024 their budget was $251
34:12
billion which includes mandatory spending along with the Student Loan program pel grants and grants for
34:18
vacational training so Department of Education their funding and their allocation in a
34:23
nutshell thank you Reuters link will be posted in the dis chat in the Discord yeah I just uh I don't understand why
34:30
more people aren't screaming from the rooftops that we are not getting a good
34:35
outcome that is a crazy part to me um Thomas Soul wrote a book called charter
34:41
schools and their enemies I'm pretty sure that's the the exact title uh but the the central
34:49
question of that book is why would people push back against this idea where you have one set of um principles that
34:57
youi an absolutely god-- awful outcome and then you have another set of principles that yield a great
35:02
outcome that's where I want to see people focus what is the desired output
35:08
and is that system yielding that output and if not you need to be making changes to that system and there needs to be a
35:16
cohesive um hypothesis on why the changes that you're going to make are actually going to yield that outcome and
35:23
it is really interesting America makes a lot of sense or the left in America makes a lot of sense when you understand
35:29
this idea of wanting to psychologically protect children from the realities that they're not as good as somebody else
35:36
um but that yields a really bad outcome
35:41
yeah oh yeah yeah uh TR put Drew on blast right now with Lisa Lisa in the chat um Eric I just slacked you a
35:48
picture that's hilarious Drew don't judge a Woman based on her husband the funny thing is babe I thought the exact
35:53
same thing I was like oh my poor wife so we um we're working with a company or we
36:00
were considering I can't remember if this is the one that we moved forward with but anyway there was going to be a company that was going to help Lisa uh
36:05
and the first thing that they said was you need to create distance between you and your husband because now that your
36:10
husband talks politics it is hurting your channel and I was like my poor wife because of me uh she is getting drugged
36:18
down it's all too true it's all too true don't judge a Woman by your husband oh actually I lie judge a Woman by your
36:25
husband 100% it is true because I was literally just talking to oh God I won't
36:33
say who I was talking to I am certain they will hear this and they will recognize themselves and I said uh if
36:40
your woman is not in your ear pushing you to be a better more aggressive man
36:46
you need to replace her I did a screenshot Eric so it's easier to pull it up boys and girls that is how in fact
36:54
gentlemen out there I'm saying right now uh if you are if you're with somebody
37:02
who's not making you better stronger more aggressive it's time to it's time to swap out that's just real talk now
37:09
that is my wife hardcore was pushing me when we were
37:14
living in her mother's house that woman was nonstop trying to motivate me to be
37:19
a better person and uh I will eternally be grateful to her for
37:26
that um okay so Robert Zane uh reposted what Lisa posted yesterday if we can zoom in
37:32
on that so Tom can see it so for those listening posted this this is Lisa Lisa yeah Lisa posted yeah
37:39
on the left side what do you see in him and it's a old picture of Lisa and Tom there's the caption dirt poor what is he
37:44
wearing unemployed he's not your type and then on the right you're so lucky cool hot successful stylish he's so
37:50
smart and it just shows you don't this actually makes me emotional like I
37:56
am I'm not a crier but if something were going to move I literally see it I literally see like the gloss on the eyes
38:02
this is beautiful uh man I am so glad that we got together when we literally
38:09
had nothing God I look terrible uh and you're wearing a man bag by the way well
38:15
okay okay hold on hold on that was to carry a dog in my defense
38:20
so yes I will MERS it uh for my dog shout out to Batman who was our our
38:26
first dog uh yes so hiding in that bag is a little dog that you can't see but
38:34
um my wife then girlfriend was
38:41
extraordinarily good at making me feel good about who I was currently and making it abundantly clear
38:48
that I better get better how you pull that off like that is tough because she had to make me feel
38:54
good about who I was otherwise uh I'm not here for somebody that's hanging me yeah uh she had to make me feel good
39:01
about who I was but at the same time had to be pushing me in a direction to be better now the crazy thing is I don't
39:09
know how consciously she was doing it it would actually be very interesting uh next Monday Lisa is gonna be um being
39:18
she's gonna be here with me in the the co-host seat so it be interesting to Reas this question chat please remind me
39:25
um but I don't know how consciously she was doing it but she was doing it and if
39:30
I can just talk really nakedly I often speak in uh in an oblique way on this
39:38
but women when you're in a romantic relationship with somebody you have many
39:43
tools that other people don't have the most important of them is sex and you
39:51
have to be careful because you want to walk a fine line you don't want to be sexually manipulative but
39:58
using sex like one thing my wife could always do for me that has always been so
40:04
powerful when I did something that was powerful in the world um stood up for
40:11
myself pushed for more was aggressive she would give me that look of like oh
40:16
my God you're really turning me on right now and then would richly reward me for my very masculine drive for the pursuit
40:24
um to work harder to push farther to stand stand up for myself like because my journey has been one of learning to
40:30
be stronger tougher more aggressive that was not my default State and by rewarding me in the ways
40:38
that only a wife can it really put me down a path uh that I
40:44
have that has yielded tremendous results in the world and it's like I want that
40:51
thing for people I want people to understand the dynamic in a ROM rtic
40:57
relationship that has existed for all of human history where when you reward
41:04
behavior that you want to see more of and you people are going to hate this language punish behaviors you want to
41:10
see less of it will shape somebody and when
41:16
you're a unit and you have the unit's best interests at heart now it's like I
41:22
want something that's good for us and so I'm not pushing you like this to be a
41:28
[ __ ] I'm pushing you like this because this is what I believe is good for the unit given that we have a stated goal of
41:33
what we're trying to achieve these behaviors are or are not going to take us there and I want to reward those and
41:41
so I am so glad that I found a peer in
41:46
my wife not somebody who
41:53
um not somebody who I want to get away from or I looked down on like I was never the guy that was like I just want
41:59
to be with my boys and my girl thinks so dumb ball and chain yeah I was like man I don't understand that approach to life
42:06
so having a peer somebody who wanted what was good for the unit which also
42:12
happened to be good for me and knew how to reward me boy oh boy and there was uh
42:19
speaking of not being a crier one of the times in my life where I legitimately
42:24
wept was this was long before cameras were a part of the picture I could see what she was doing I could see she was
42:31
making me a better person and I really broke down one day because I was getting credit for something I don't even remember what uh
42:38
and I said no one you're never going to get the credit you deserve for the man that I'm becoming
42:45
and I was like really devastated by that because I was like [ __ ] I don't know how to articulate this I don't know how to
42:53
um because at that time she was a housewife and so I was like [ __ ] like I don't know how to pull this into the
43:00
world and say like yo I fully recognize that you are my peer I fully recognize
43:06
that I'm married to my equal and I don't know how to get you
43:11
credit for everything you've ever done I couldn't predicted that I'd be on camera one day and be able to get to you know
43:17
say things like this for the world to see that's what I want for people it's
43:22
awesome that's beautiful you give me hope Tom love is still out there love is out there I feel like I'm like your
43:28
single friend in like a romcom and it's just like oh and I'm just like yeah okay then I go home and like eat snacks on my
43:34
couch or something and eat a tub of ice cream um okay you want to talk to haris uh I kind of want to talk about you
43:40
eating the chips and the ice cream uh let's just real fast close that Loop because the streets are trash social
43:47
media and dating apps have really created delusion I think we've talked about this
43:55
before but if I could do a PS say for a second okay I think the following is the
44:01
primary problem because there are so many other
44:07
fish in the sea people are trying to optimize for
44:12
the perfect match off the Jump like not even the perfect match the that they
44:19
meet the checklist perfectly yeah that was one thing Lisa and I did
44:24
not fall prey to and so in the beginning I'm sure despite the initial attraction
44:32
in fact not I'm sure let me be very specific when I decided when I was
44:38
thinking seriously about propos proposing to Lisa I actually wrote a pros and cons
44:45
list and there were cons and there were things about her that I not only didn't like that I was very worried about on a
44:53
long enough timeline would be so problematic that I should not move forward with her wow uh the one that I
45:01
remember so clearly she gets sick a
45:07
lot and I was like I'm not a caretaker That's Not My Vibe I just hey I'm glad
45:14
that there are some people and I respect the [ __ ] out of people that are caretakers I'm not one of them and I was
45:20
like am I really going to uh move forward with somebody that is
45:28
that is sick frequently am I actually going to be able to deal with that and there were other things I actually don't
45:34
remember them I'm not being koi if I remember them I just [ __ ] say them uh but when I looked at the pros list I
45:42
was like the the exact phrase I said to myself at the end of that list was I'm either never getting married or I'm
45:49
marrying this woman but I would say to her face I bet there there are other people
45:56
out there that I could marry and I would have just as wonderful of a life and so I don't want you to feel
46:03
like you have to constantly be looking over your shoulder to make sure that there's nobody better than you what this
46:09
is is commitment so I have a tattoo that I got when we got married as a ritualistic
46:15
scarification I know it sounds silly because everybody gets tattoos now but that's how I approached it it is the
46:20
only tattoo that I have despite my wife practically begging me to get more tattoos because she [ __ ] finds it
46:26
sexy and my thing is no I wanted to do something painful to be a different
46:32
person the day after getting married than I was the day before so we got married and then uh after our honeymoon
46:39
for reasons that don't matter I ended up getting the tattoo as a way to remind myself I'm now a different man and there
46:45
are only four words on it and one of them is commitment and commitment is
46:51
saying I get that there are other fish in the sea I get that there are more beautiful women than you and that
46:57
doesn't matter to me I'm in a relationship with you we have chosen each other I am committed to making this
47:05
relationship work not a relationship work this relationship that's good and so I understand that you're not perfect
47:13
as I understand that I am not perfect and so each of us have a pros and cons
47:18
list on the other person but we draw a line and for me that was The Proposal The Proposal was hard for me I was like
47:26
am I really to do this the marriage was easy because once
47:31
I made a decision that was that I was ready to get the tattoo as a part of The
47:37
Proposal I didn't and I think it's better in terms of Pomp and Circumstances ceremony to do it around
47:42
the wedding but that to me was the line was like once I propose that's the end
47:49
game and now we're in this social media and dating apps have given people the
47:54
exact opposite understanding of what a relationship is there's always somebody I can swipe to and get to the next person get to the next person get to the
48:01
next person um you're going to be with somebody
48:06
who's going to shape you shape and be shaped want that don't
48:13
want this is them right from the jump now I get it people are like oh this [ __ ] wants to change me yeah that's
48:19
Evolution welcome to the party yeah and it's interesting to say that because I'm
48:25
also I'm starting to realize that you have to want that level of accountability because it does take uh
48:32
understanding of self to say I am okay with being changed I want to be changed um me having like a child early I was
48:40
forced to handle responsibility in a different way than some of my friends so right after I had Lyn my senior year in
48:47
college I didn't have that transition of like oh now I have a full-time job and I have like discretionary spending like
48:53
I'm still living as a college student but I'm getting paid 80 grand let me go do some things like it was a different kind of level so I went right from
48:59
school to like domestic mode so I took one responsibility on and kind of carried on another so I never had that
49:05
like [ __ ] boy phase of just like out here spending money or just out here like traveling going on vacation taking
49:11
a bunch of Instagram pictures and I think that a lot of times what I'm been running against is that I would meet
49:16
somebody that likes who they are and it's to your point of take me as I am but then with me of always like that
49:22
well you know we got to do this and we got to do this like we have to go to the next responsibility that can sometimes
49:27
be a trigger for certain people and that's something that I didn't I had to acknowledge in myself as well like okay
49:33
not everybody wants to become a better version of themselves not everybody wants to get better now everybody has that mindset um so it's interesting that
49:40
you kind of put that nail of like change and be change because some people are resistant to change some people want to
49:46
just be like this and have somebody who loves them like this and they want to stay in this box and but you can also do it in a [ __ ] way that's really [ __ ]
49:53
horrible and makes the guy want to donkey punch you and get the [ __ ] out so this is where and I do see the red
49:59
light will this is where like it is a dance and if my wife did not make me
50:05
feel if my girlfriend did not make me feel better about who I was when I was with her than when I wasn't she would
50:12
never have become my wife so it's like you have to earn the right to shape Somebody by letting them know I'm Into
50:19
You right now today and I can't wait to see who we can become together that was
50:24
the vibe that was the energy now there were definitely times where people have heard me tell the story a million times
50:30
it was ultimately shame that pushed me to make change and my then fiance was
50:39
not impressed that she had a job I did not she would come home and I would just be at like 12:30 or something and I
50:47
would just be crawling out of bed and I only got out of bed so I could make her a sandwich I mean it's really crazy when
50:52
I tell the story that it was actually true it was actually true uh and that my hair was wasn't done and I was wearing
50:57
my pajamas still and she was just like this isn't cool she was just like you don't even do your hair and so there was
51:03
this element of like what are you doing and so all of
51:09
that leads to change but then if I do my hair and I show up you got to be like yo
51:18
I love this this is so cool like thank you you can't be like well finally like
51:23
you did the thing like she was just like oh my God I love it your hair look so great like this is fantastic thank you
51:28
so much like this really means a lot to me that you're up and you're excited and so it was there were rewards think of it
51:35
like a bank account you can make withdrawals if you've made enough deposits if you have not made enough
51:40
deposits you can't make a withdrawal yeah it's a good way to put it it's good way to put it um yeah man all right now if you want
51:48
to take us oh sorry we have a red light we give it to us not a theories back
51:57
we got not a theory first um they said that you're going to make
52:02
them go broke at this rate having to put a Super Chat to say thinkk your comment on encourage and strive same direction
52:09
doesn't always mean same path you two are a force yes same direction is not always
52:16
the same path I agree with that but I can't tell if you're saying watch out for when you were not on the same path
52:23
or if you're saying that's perfectly fine uh I would say it is perfectly fine that men and women come at life
52:29
extremely differently and the odds of you guys being on the same path are effectively zero uh but if you're trying
52:36
to end up in the same place now you're in business so if that's what you mean you and I are on the same page daddy
52:43
issues are fine I just saw that go by uh depends on the level of the daddy issue
52:48
I would say you can get yourself in real trouble all right do we have any other
52:54
uh Super Chat 1999 one which I think I'll they missed bu a penny you got to have a line that's our Line in the Sand
53:01
but boys and girls remember because there's no way you did that on purpose so uh remember if you want to interrupt
53:07
in the first hour $20 is and higher is the only way to do it um and if it's
53:13
less than that we'll save it till the next hour so you guys are only like five minutes out uh Robert MAA says gold
53:19
diggers ever heard about it I have Robert and if my wife is a gold digger good Lord that woman was patient and was
53:27
willing to help build the mine out so that she could then dig for gold uh so
53:33
yeah definitely always makes us laugh when people call Lisa a gold digger because boy oh boy uh she's good at
53:40
picking minds but absolutely terrible at yielding results very quickly it took her a long time to reap any benefits all
53:47
right Jake Jake K is coming in hot here oh this is a good one here we go all
53:52
right criticism I'll even read this one out loud will uh Tom you are such a cuck
53:57
which I'm guessing spelled weird because otherwise you would get grabbed uh women date across and up agreed uh she would
54:04
have left you long ago had your performance not accelerated okay are we saying that's bad uh they
54:12
want the winners at the Finish Line yes uh out of touch or mating out of touch
54:18
on mating dating otherwise I love your content Jake thank you so first of all guys I I have no problem with criticism
54:25
whatsoever so by all means uh bring it because if you see something that I don't you're only going to make me smarter so Jake here is what I would say
54:33
to that the whole point of shaping and being shaped is that you want a better
54:38
version I've gotten a better version of Lisa over time and if Lisa did not have
54:43
a growth mindset and Lisa were a problem and Lisa were making this I did make you broke Lisa that is for sure um for a
54:52
while I made up for it uh if Lisa became a problem I would have left Lisa So Lisa
54:59
and I have been very clear with each other that this is not um unconditional love that there are lines that can't be
55:06
crossed and if Lisa were making me miserable and this were a Loveless marriage and she didn't have a growth
55:11
mindset and she was dragging me down then I wouldn't stay in that relationship either so 100% if she were
55:19
still the same person that I married I would have zero interest if I were still the same person that she married I
55:25
assume she would have zero interest so this is about having a shared goal that
55:30
you um have articulated and then you're moving towards that goal now in Lisa's defense she actually at one point really
55:38
pushed me to make a decision that was financially terrible uh I came home one day and she said okay you are now
55:44
damaging our marriage she didn't say in the pursuit of wealth but that was the thing hiding I had become so unhappy at my job
55:52
because I was just showing up every day trying to get rich trying to prove that my father-in-law was wrong um I want to read that comment from Lisa
55:59
hold on uh and she said look I don't care about the money I want you to be
56:04
happy and so she has earned her stripes in that she has proven when it really
56:10
mattered she was like we we were going to move to a small town in Greece where
56:15
we could rent like a small little place and I could write a screenplay because she believed one she believed that I
56:21
would be good enough at that that we'd then be able to come back to Hollywood and take it over so there was still ambition hiding in all of that she
56:27
wasn't like yeah surrender your life but she was like do do a thing that you're
56:33
fun to be around do a thing that makes you happy she was like you used to be so alive and she was like you're so unhappy
56:40
and you will come home and you'll say literally don't ask me about my day I I don't want to think about it I don't
56:46
want to talk about it when I would drive into the office it was like driving into a place with storm clouds over it drew
56:53
for years I couldn't go to Marina del Rey without feeling like I was going into that Darkness because that period
56:59
of my life was so dark and my wife who
57:05
wanted to see me do better make more money be the guy that crosses the Finish Line was like your happiness and our
57:14
shared love of day-to-day life is so important to me I don't give a [ __ ] if
57:19
you have to step backwards I don't care if we've got to be even poorer for an
57:25
unknown number of years MH I want to be happy I want to enjoy today now again
57:32
this was still in pursuit of being ambitious and going and doing the thing that I loved and all of that but she had a chance to be like [ __ ] you I'm GNA go
57:39
find somebody else and instead said I want you to be happy all right uh Lisa
57:44
Bly says Jake is seeing it from his own lens of course as we all do because it's so not true that I worry why he thinks
57:51
that in the first place so In fairness to Jake the streets really do strike me as trash right now and I think that
57:59
there is massive dysfunction in the frame of reference of people who always
58:05
want to swipe Left Right which one says uh right right right is I want to find
58:11
somebody else oh left left I don't like right I'm I'm into it got it so they want to swipe left to find somebody else
58:16
always more more swiping left even on their own person uh I get why people want to do that but
58:24
it is a mistake ultimately you're going to realize that nobody is perfect and
58:30
that you are going to um either be alone or a string of relationships or you're
58:37
going to find somebody who is as imperfect as you and you're going to find a way to navigate this life a
58:44
little better because you have somebody that removes some of your blind spots David summerly says love this I
58:50
have the fortune of finding the woman as well a uh we'll get where we're headed
58:55
together I love it David I love it you were about to say something um
59:01
yeah the whole dating over and dating up thing I feel like it's a little it's an excuse at this point like it's kind of a
59:08
out like as long as you accept that it is true but is also being used as a
59:14
cudel to somehow shame women for reasons I don't know because to me it's it's a
59:21
it's a pot it's a pot of ingredients like if you have yes you need sugar and flour to make a cake but if you only
59:26
have sugar and flour that doesn't mean your cake is going to be good agreed but can we also agree that men will date
59:32
down for a hot woman they literally don't care about her financial her access to financial resources yes they
59:39
in some cases uh don't even care about her intellect and whether they can uh
59:44
meet him as a peer if she's attractive enough there is a subset of men for whom
59:51
that's like yeah no problem yeah but I also think there's a subset of woman that also would date down if you make her feel a certain type of way way if
59:56
you make her feel the way that she wants to be felt at that moment she would Overlook a lot of things yes and I think that is a suicide run and she she will
1:00:04
be profoundly unhappy and that relationship will go nowhere fast this is why admitting that you're having a
1:00:11
biological experience is so important so there is an evolutionary algorithm in your brain that is screaming dear woman
1:00:18
uh having children is so evolutionarily expensive that if you don't date a man
1:00:23
that can get access to resources um then you are at risk and so I really believe
1:00:30
and then men have a similar the reverse of that evolutionary algorithm which says you need to be aggressive you need
1:00:35
to be ambitious you need to strive for more uh you need to protect you need to care for and when those things get out
1:00:41
of whack you see unhappiness um and the
1:00:47
I don't have an official stat that I can point to but I'll say people would be very hardpressed
1:00:53
to change my belief in the following because it has so much predictive validity in terms of whether people will
1:00:58
end up happy that a woman who is with a non- amiti male and a man who is with a
1:01:04
woman who is far more ambitious and successful than him that that relationship will work uh I think the
1:01:09
odds are excruciatingly low and so while I agree with you much like a drug a woman will make a short-term mistake he
1:01:16
makes me feel good about myself he makes me feel accepted uh without looking at what will this play out like over 20 30
1:01:24
years of I'm more ambitious than him I'm more successful than him uh that's going
1:01:30
to be tough so I know that by Lisa and I not having kids it's far more dangerous for her than it is for me far more
1:01:36
dangerous and she really has to think about that and so for years now I've
1:01:42
pulled her aside at an unspecified interval but call it every four to six
1:01:48
months been like hey you sure you don't want kids like cuz there are only so many exit ramps left where it's like we
1:01:55
could still potentially have kids right now probably adoption is about the only thing that we have left so I'm like you
1:02:00
sure you sure you good um because if she goes into that blindly and doesn't
1:02:06
understand what nature is doing to her brain she's gonna really get caught off guard and that will be bad mojo so
1:02:11
anyway I think women I think both men and women are not being honest enough about the evolutionary algorithms in
1:02:17
their brain this leads people to a lot of quiet desperation um and this is why
1:02:23
their relationships don't Thrive even if they're in one so yeah women
1:02:29
should I'll stop shy of saying a but women should date over or up yeah and
1:02:37
then as always there's those uh asteris and French people they are men who are the exceptions and women who are the
1:02:43
exceptions of French people what Fring FR Fringe I was like I feel like I hallucinated that how's he goingon to
1:02:49
make this make the French St different n no but yeah there's people on the fringes that are just like that there's people who self sabotage and all these
1:02:54
things so for Jake to say say this is how it is and I agree it could be 99.9%
1:03:00
but there's always exceptions to the rules yeah yeah it's probably not even 99.9% but it's uh play the averages boys
1:03:05
and girls I always get worried when people try to deny their biology it's the one thing that's the odds of you
1:03:11
being the exception are so [ __ ] low there are Exceptions there are but
1:03:19
woof um okay uh we're in the second hour first of all back Jak cling back all
1:03:26
right Hey Jake Jake is paying for the privilege okay so Tom there are only x amount of men who can Excel above most
1:03:32
men By definition most men will be average and with women only dating across and up mating dating is now
1:03:39
untenable for average men look at divorce rates never your girl just your turn Okay so one Jake I want to make
1:03:46
sure that you feel um heard on this because we're saying the same
1:03:51
thing women men and women have adopted on mass frames of reference which do not
1:03:59
serve them well so what you're saying is because of that frame of reference the streets are trash remember I'm agreeing
1:04:05
with you the streets are trash like there really is a problem what I'm trying to help people do is Adopt a new
1:04:13
frame of reference that will free them from the frame of reference that is holding them back so uh I think that
1:04:20
you're probably right that there is a massive amount of women for whom it is
1:04:25
uh not your girl it's just your turn that we're in a cultural moment where people are caught up in an energy that
1:04:31
is not going to serve them this is not me saying that isn't true this is me saying guys you're going to want to
1:04:38
reorient because you've got to move culture back to a place that makes sense
1:04:43
so I'm trying to paint a picture of a frame of reference that has higher predictive validity and that if you
1:04:48
adopt it it's going to move you in a good direction not saying that that's how it is currently please go back so uh
1:04:56
I want to make sure that you hear me saying that because I I hear your Lamentations and I get it man I agree I
1:05:02
would not want to be in that position right now because now you're looking for a needle in a Hy stack now admittedly I
1:05:08
think that there are ways to Short Circuit some of that so it's something I
1:05:13
call trapping someone in their values I don't think people ask each other enough
1:05:20
questions if you are early in a relationship with somebody and you start
1:05:25
talking values rather than checklist and you just start asking them questions about what it is that they value in a
1:05:31
relationship what do you look for in a man do you value permanence um do you want to share a life with one person
1:05:37
even if that person wasn't um on a long enough timeline you realize that that person is not perfect in every way what
1:05:44
would you do if you were in a 10-year relationship with somebody who you can tell is sincerely trying to get better
1:05:50
and you're at a cocktail party and a guy who is way more successful uh is hitting
1:05:56
on you what would you do in that situation like there are all kinds of questions you can ask somebody where you get down to their values most people
1:06:03
have not examined their values so I remember asking Lisa a question this is going to make some people mad but early
1:06:09
very early maybe first date early I asked her why do you believe in God and not like a hey you're so dumb why do you
1:06:17
believe in God like a legitimate curiosity oh why do you believe in God and she was like damn I've never thought
1:06:23
about that before and so that became a point of exploration for her in
1:06:29
her own life and so by talking about these things openly you can really begin
1:06:35
to figure out who each other are and if you share enough core values that when there's friction in the relationship you
1:06:41
can say well hold on a second you said XYZ like if Lisa said hey the thing I care most about um is your happiness but
1:06:49
it needs to be nested in ambition I need to know that you're really trying to get better um
1:06:56
if she's ever out of step with that I can say well hold on a second this is what you said historically what are you saying now and so it brings things to
1:07:02
the Forefront it makes somebody confront their own value system I think that will take people far farther than they think
1:07:07
they're going to because um I don't know what's the term a [ __ ] girl like if there's [ __ ] boys there [ __ ] girls what
1:07:13
do we say to a girl this hot girls hot girls City girl or 304
1:07:18
ho that's amazing hot girl City girl uh okay so if you're a hot girl City girl 304 uh if you're in that the odds that
1:07:27
that person self-identifies at is basically zero so if you start talking at the level of values anyway you can
1:07:32
pull this into the light all right there was one more element of this I wanted to address most men will be average yes most men will be average that is correct
1:07:39
so uh this is why I say across or up so uh not every woman can get the highest
1:07:45
level guy so for instance um for as successful as I have been I am not the
1:07:54
most successful guy on planet Earth So Lisa has had to confront the fact that
1:08:00
she's not with the most successful guy on earth now maybe she still holds out hope I don't know uh my wife does not
1:08:05
seem motivated by more money um but my wife remains turned on by ambition
1:08:14
aggression um but she would never do it the the the times that I have always upset my wife the most are the times
1:08:20
where I've hardened up too much one of the biggest fights that we've gotten into in the last fight years was her
1:08:26
trying to explain to me uh she now says I need a soft place to land but before she just kept saying I want my husband
1:08:33
back I was like what the [ __ ] are you saying like I don't understand what you're trying to communicate what she
1:08:39
was trying to communicate after many arguments was I need you to be able to broadcast and receive love not I need
1:08:47
you to make more money not I need you to out compete more men it was I need you
1:08:53
to broadcast and receive love and I was like oh got it I'm I'm too hardened i'
1:09:00
I've become too tough I've lost some of the playfulness that you enjoyed heard
1:09:05
cool now that I understand what you're looking for and I understand what I have moved away from she wasn't shaping me to
1:09:11
be a better entrepreneur now it was like okay you went too far in that direction for her to receive what she needed it
1:09:16
was moving in the opposite direction anyway uh those were all the words there I want you to feel heard I get it agreed
1:09:23
but now it's like what's the new new frame of reference that you need to adopt that women need to adopt you being
1:09:29
men on mass so that we can get to a better place and and just really quick Jake you spent $120 or so on this
1:09:37
live could have went out with a girl you could have took her to a date how dare you Jake God bless you for every dollar
1:09:44
that you have spent dating across and dating up you just got to have sometimes you just have the or you just got to have that Persona you don't necessarily
1:09:50
need to throw a bun of money around like you know what be like if you really want to f
1:09:56
how is this both great advice and terrible at the same time okay so you really do have to be
1:10:02
him okay this episode is just gonna be about relationships I promise chat we will get to politics at some point uh
1:10:10
but really fast Drew as somebody I actually care about as a human I will
1:10:16
say the following you've got enough game that that's not going to be the problem you're swaave you got a good style
1:10:21
you're good-looking you're smart y y you're not going to have to worry about that you know that's true I think uh so
1:10:29
all of that is necessary and I couldn't get laid until I realized oh I have to
1:10:35
have no fear of loss so I've got to go into every exchange with a woman being like I don't care I'm going to be
1:10:42
aggressively myself and if you're into who I am great and if you're not then I
1:10:48
understand that I have to be willing to walk away and that stopped being a question of anxiety to me and started
1:10:55
being being a I wouldn't have had the words back then but it's just that's the
1:11:00
biological reality of the situation is confidence is a cue to women that you
1:11:05
will do well okay so if I cannot display confidence I will never be able to
1:11:12
attract a mate I accept now that that is true and so instead of rolling up with poetry and flowers which is I actually
1:11:20
did that um that strategy doesn't work I have to be confident so you're right
1:11:25
about that uh at the same time the thing that Jake and everybody
1:11:32
trapped in the trash streets have to come to grips with is we are living in a
1:11:39
world where the frame of reference yields a deranging result so I have to
1:11:44
go into this knowing they have a Swip left mentality I have to somehow Short Circuit the
1:11:51
swipe left mentality the hypothesis that I'm putting forward is you've got to
1:11:57
meet them in real life you have to ascertain their values you've got to find people that when you start asking
1:12:04
them questions they're like this guy's different there's something here this is
1:12:09
interesting and
1:12:14
displaying the thing about you that makes you special if you know it's not going to be money because they're always
1:12:20
going to be able to find somebody that makes more money MH then it's got to be
1:12:26
something else and what is the game that you can play well and I learn very quickly if you want to be interesting be
1:12:34
interested start asking them questions start getting them talking about themselves which they will love and then
1:12:41
you can also use that as a way to reveal who they are and if you get them thinking about things that they've never
1:12:47
thought about before they're going to be like huh this person's interesting now if they're insecure about it they're
1:12:53
like I don't like they're you're making me challenge things and I don't even know how to process through that then you move on but um you you need to
1:13:01
understand what is the game that you're actually playing this is so I got asked a question in one of my early early days
1:13:06
of speaking publicly was at Google this is like I didn't know what woke was and
1:13:13
uh young black guy in the crowd says Tom do you think that black people have to work harder to succeed and I was like
1:13:20
almost certainly but now what
1:13:26
that that's what it is and so if you know that you're going to have to outperform people there are two paths
1:13:33
before you path number one is become an activist okay it's not the path I would
1:13:39
choose if I were in your shoes I'm on the Kobe Bryant path you can get so good at something no matter how much somebody
1:13:45
hates you they can't stop you from doing it I would advise that you take that path and just go get good and the fact
1:13:52
that you have to get better sucks but if that is true now it's just like face it
1:13:58
head on so if the streets are trash and women have this angle it's like well
1:14:03
you're coming into the game that's where we're at don't waste your time being an activist or lamenting against it just go
1:14:10
how do I win which is to have a loving in my opinion peer relationship with
1:14:16
another person to share your life cool so now how do I win in that game okay well I've got to get him out of that
1:14:22
frame of reference how am I going to get him out of that frame of reference we've talked about it but that's how I would be approaching it and just like there
1:14:29
are days where I have fantasized about becoming addicted to opiates just so that I could show people that you can
1:14:34
get off them uh it's like I I want to be back on the streets just to show people
1:14:40
there is a way around this I would never do either of them but God is it tempting
1:14:45
in the deranged recesses of my mind drew it is so tempting because there's always
1:14:50
a solution there's always a solution all right um I think we have one more Super Chat and then yes we're going to get
1:14:56
back to the headline and thumbnail Selena I saw your message yes we went on a tangent about relationships and Selena's not here for it we got get [ __ ]
1:15:03
off this call a ditch uh oh all right we got calling it out we got one more Super Chat um it's
1:15:10
from Maas how will men experience transformative patience patience when AI
1:15:17
soon sets an entertainable Benchmark likewise AGI will outmatch most men in
1:15:23
resource acquisition will this make dating even tougher than apps exponentially transformative patience
1:15:29
that is a great question what's transformative patience though is that like I was on the second part okay let's
1:15:35
move the second part likewise AGI will outmatch most men in resource acquisition will this make dating even
1:15:41
tougher than apps um okay so there are going to be life is going
1:15:47
to branch and people are either going to merge with technology in which case we are now technological singularity I
1:15:53
cannot give you any insight into what that world is going to look like I can think like a Sci-Fi writer and paint pictures but the reality is the only
1:15:59
thing I know is it won't be that um it might be directionally correct but we we cannot anticipate the actual changes
1:16:05
that are going to come the other side is people will Double Down On Being Human and so
1:16:11
reaching into the future you want to be you don't want to try to out ai ai you want to be uniquely human the
1:16:18
transformative patient part means how Lisa was super patient with you becoming
1:16:23
the man that you are Lisa was not patient uh so yeah it's interesting it it did
1:16:29
not feel like nor would I recommend to somebody to be patient life is a marathon at a
1:16:36
sprinter's pace if you're trying to succeed at any high level and that's how
1:16:42
it felt going through it was um it was like I don't want change in a year I want change now but it wasn't it's very
1:16:49
important that people understand it was not some big Grand Lisa beating me with a stick until I became the man that she wanted me to be it was 30 vacillations
1:16:57
in any one day between oh I like this and I don't like that on both sides uh
1:17:02
and so on balance it felt awesome like being with Lisa felt awesome like in in
1:17:08
the moments but also I felt completely ashamed at times of who I was uh but it
1:17:14
wasn't like the only color in my life was deep in abiding shame and my then girlfriend or fiance was beating me de
1:17:20
beating me to death to become somebody better uh it was this constant fluctuation of I love things about you
1:17:26
and I dislike things about you so anyway you're going to out a you're going to outperform AI by Being Human by being by
1:17:32
leaning into your humanity and doing things that AI uh will not be able to do
1:17:38
and if the thing that AI is unable to do is to have a backstory as a human that's
1:17:43
lived through it and gone through it uh and has the scars to show for it great then that's going to be the part that we lean into the empathy the understanding
1:17:50
um to another human being of what that's like because you've gone through it then that's the play but don't try to out ai ai that is a
1:17:58
losing Endeavor okay good I think we have to at this
1:18:04
point whether I'm good or not all right all right okay yep no no
1:18:10
we're no no we gota wait we got to come back you guys gonna give me 30 minutes we gonna go off these stairs and we'll Circle back at Super Chat at the bottom
1:18:16
of the hour all right I'm putting my foot down there it is let do it all right um Trump with tariff or tariff
1:18:23
with the pro uh premiere of Ontario so you said you were traveling you didn't catch up on this we got to start at the
1:18:28
beginning with this one no no no the Tariff thing I well if you have a clip please play it yes uh but I am certainly
1:18:35
at least headline deep on the Tariff St all right Eric can we play that um the premieres uh video it's the first one
1:18:42
the libs of Tik Tok yep
1:19:23
if okay pause it for all right so let's fix the technical
1:19:30
issue if we're having one how many people in chat are saying
1:19:36
that will like yeah like eight B okay so we do have a problem ER whether it it
1:19:42
turned up is it turned up on the
1:19:48
mixer triple check that yep I hear myself s yeah they can hear us talk they
1:19:53
just can't hear the video now interesting I'm definitely hearing the
1:20:00
video uh I guess worst case Eric may need to reboot if all things seem as they should be and aren't working while
1:20:07
Eric sorts that out unless he has to take down the whole broadcast to do it
1:20:12
um so this is going to be interesting so this is all part of the chaos that
1:20:18
President Trump is creating with the way that he approaches negotiations I need
1:20:24
to read his the art of the deal because from what I hear he says plainly in the art
1:20:29
of the deal that you want to create chaos uh that you want to be patient you want to let people have their freak out
1:20:36
but ultimately if you have leverage they're going to come back to the table yeah um it is my understanding that they
1:20:41
have since backed off of this so big talk and then backed off it's very telling that Trump said they've got a
1:20:48
strong man uh I get it this is these are the going to be the kinds of things that they're going to say but they've already
1:20:53
backed off this and and I think he said I respect that they backed off of it um so he likes tough guys so when people
1:21:02
are freaking out being like yeah I'm gonna [ __ ] you up whatever uh he's not he's not plused and he's gonna ratch it
1:21:09
up and I have a feeling he's doing this cold calculation behind the scenes of like where's our leverage and if I have
1:21:15
the leverage [ __ ] these kids now the rest of us are like oh God like this is so chaotic um the markets are freaking
1:21:23
out because they like chaos I think people are very wrong to attribute to
1:21:29
Elon and Trump that they're playing like some uh [ __ ] chess where it's like no
1:21:36
no no like we want it's all anti-inflationary and we're going to pop this bubble and we're going to drive the
1:21:42
economy uh in the tank so that the average person can buy assets holy [ __ ] that I buy that as much as I buy people
1:21:48
saying uh just shoot me in the air bro uh [ __ ] that there's no way when you
1:21:54
freak out the um the markets you don't know what way they're
1:21:59
going to go so there's no Universe in which even if they get the outcome even
1:22:06
if that is what ends up playing out M ill advised you don't understand how you
1:22:12
might cause the market to freak the [ __ ] out and cause Untold damage to people no
1:22:17
way uh don't buy that now do
1:22:23
they and then go now that the king that's all right people will be able to buy at a discount sure that I will
1:22:29
believe that they create a problem and then go well but there's like a positive
1:22:35
that will come out of it always look on the bright side of life but I don't buy
1:22:42
that this is Tess chess so um I think Trump creates chaos I need to read the
1:22:48
art of the deal but I have heard people say that that is a thing that he States plainly in the book and so we are
1:22:55
watching we are living through that chaos right now
1:23:01
so he wants to establish himself as the
1:23:07
big boy he looks at the world and I'm taking this from things he's actually said he looks at the world and says okay
1:23:14
previous governments have allowed us to be taken advantage of because they this that part he has said The Following part
1:23:19
is my um interpretation that they're playing nice boy global politics and
1:23:26
they want to get along with everybody I don't care about that in the slightest um I'm going to flex our muscle I'm
1:23:33
going to show people that if they want access to the American economy that they're going to give us the quote unquote respect that we're due um and
1:23:41
what comes of that comes of that and in the long term he believes that that will be better for America uh he's playing a
1:23:49
game of chicken that that is the right way in my estimation to look at this and when you play chicken you may craft
1:23:55
headlong into the other person not blinking and the other person in all of this that I worry about is China so I'm
1:24:03
not worried about Canada Canada will fold they just don't have as he would say they don't have the cards so um the
1:24:10
cards yeah so Canada doesn't have the cards so you can probably be pretty
1:24:15
ham-handed with Canada and still get your way you can probably be pretty ham-handed with Mexico and still get
1:24:21
your way can't be ham-handed with China they are a peer competitor uh they are a
1:24:26
peer competitor militarily they are a peer competitor economically and so uh
1:24:32
on that one you you could have a head- on collision and so man I'll be real
1:24:37
[ __ ] careful with that so yeah will will they get something positive out of
1:24:43
all of this maybe uh would it be wise to look back on this and be like separate
1:24:49
two things will it be wise to look back on this and if asset prices going down allows to buy in and that would be good
1:24:56
by the way uh do we look back on this and go they did that on purpose well played no that would be a Fool's err
1:25:01
wait shoot me in the a that's exactly how I feel about that that could go so [ __ ] wrong it's just not worth the
1:25:08
risk uh on the other side establishing America as a manufacturing
1:25:16
Force I think is important um in fact this is the criticism that Destiny had
1:25:21
of me that uh he Tom does Tom not understand I think he called it comparative advantage does he not
1:25:27
understand he does understand comparative advantage I know he does so why is he saying this and I'm saying this because I believe and this map
1:25:34
people's base assumptions I believe we're in a cold war with China uh I believe that we must onore certain
1:25:41
critical manufacturing the thing that I care most about are what are the things that lead to our modern way of life so
1:25:46
that's going to be energy that's going to be chips that's going to be Rare Earth minerals like we've got to find uh
1:25:52
ways of getting that stuff inh house um that's why I get what he's doing with
1:25:58
the Ukraine Andor Russia quite frankly um having a larger degree of distrust
1:26:06
for China I think is wise so not getting your Rare Earth minerals from China I think is smart um
1:26:13
so with that base assumption that's why I say you Trump's
1:26:19
tariffs will onshore certain things and that is a good thing um but not to be
1:26:25
confused with I don't I think that Trump is inviting a level of chaos that is so high risk both things are true yeah it's
1:26:33
was very chaotic Ontario clapped back with their tariffs Trump was like okay 25 is turning into 50 and then
1:26:39
ultimately Ontario walked their back Howard lton went over there and they're allegedly reworking the North America
1:26:44
trade deal so hopefully to your point of him causing chaos is just a inciting
1:26:51
incident to bring everybody to the table so that way they can sit down and then start talking through and maybe get better and fairer trade deals but it it
1:26:58
is chaotic and the markets have reacted and people are nervous um but you brought up the destiny clip so it made me want to pull that up Eric I just
1:27:05
liked to if you can pull that Destiny clip
1:27:13
Up chat please either confirm or disconfirm that you have audio on
1:27:20
this AI is working its way
1:27:44
is all right audio um are we going to have to reboot
1:27:51
to get audio back that is a very good short-term solution
1:27:57
thank you William so we have to rule that out as a
1:28:05
way to check this at least today maybe normally that works but clearly is not working
1:28:11
now this is a very self-reflexive Loop here watching myself on camera is
1:28:26
good Lord okay so hold on if they can hear
1:28:31
now you have started over for the third time
1:29:02
people are not hearing are we being trolled at this point because if you have a mic on the
1:29:08
speaker is it that you need to come over to the TV Eric with the mic uh volume's
1:29:13
coming out of the laptop and are people hearing my voice right
1:29:20
now your all right hold on we're gonna
1:29:26
copy that Drew is playing the stream he says yes we hear your voice
1:29:33
that's so weird yeah that's weird okay we understand you guys can
1:29:39
hear us we're just trying to figure out why it's not working on matter of fact we're gonna do this
1:29:47
chat oh chat you're gonna have to forgive us I don't know what's happening today we are having a absolute cluster
1:29:53
here okay I'll just I'll play it from mine how about that cash me outside how about
1:30:02
that audio Lisa confirming so weird don't know what's happening all right
1:30:08
Eric you want to restart it and start okay
1:30:25
pause it for a second uh Eric to avoid I guess we just have to reboot yep what's
1:30:32
that I I guess we'll just have to reboot uh will that take down the whole stream yes yes so I'm just saying uh you have
1:30:40
to turn the volume down on your computer let Drew keep playing it copy but it's coming from you and from him all
1:30:51
right okay and then also if you guys remember I once said make sure you reboot right before we go live
1:30:58
did we do that and it still glitched out or did we forget to reboot we didn't do that you want me to play it
1:31:07
online and the more I look into tariffs no he's not changing don't say it pause
1:31:13
it for a sec no it's all why does he think that I'm about to change my tune I don't understand he like PA he's like
1:31:19
he's not about to do this like he he's like he's working the crap okay okay good got it got
1:31:29
it actually and people are saying can you start over Jesus Christ all right guys we're gonna have to reboot this
1:31:35
this drive me crazy uh so we'll be right back wait I just heard his back I heard
1:31:42
good got it all we got
1:31:48
it he can't turn it down it won't work yes I can oh you got it yep Oh you had to untape it I see all right all right
1:31:54
we'll try this if this doesn't work we are [ __ ] rebooting all right we're going to start it over and try it from the
1:32:00
top Eric can you uh play the video just so the chat can see it all right I'm
1:32:05
from the beginning one two three to Destiny's point he did say that
1:32:10
across the board terorists were bad and you're like yeah if he does across the board tffs that would be like [ __ ] crazy and Trump is doing across theboard
1:32:16
Terrace right now right so do you hear me championing them now or do you hear me being very consistent with that
1:32:22
because my hypothesis remains that you're going to put yourself in a position where you are now playing
1:32:28
chicken now admittedly I don't know how it will play out and the more I look
1:32:34
into tariffs no he's not changing his he don't say it no it's all
1:32:40
roads every sign falls away and all roads lead to Rome I'm making a dramatic assumption
1:32:46
for literally no reason I'm just I'm making a dramatic for no reason he's going to say the more I look into it the more I'm realizing it is a really bad
1:32:52
thing but also even bad that he's done the like I'm waiting to see how this plays
1:32:58
out how long he already did them and the more I look into tariffs the more I'm
1:33:04
like okay it it has one outcome which is it will onshore manufacturing
1:33:13
no no no I we just have to have a business
1:33:19
talk because Tom this is also a thing he he Tom knows
1:33:24
know Tom absolutely knows what comparative advantage is I know he I
1:33:30
know from personal conversations not in those economic words but like if I were to go to Tom Tom I need business advice
1:33:35
I'm really really really good at streaming I'm so bad at like managing my um at my email on my finances okay help
1:33:43
me get better at managing my email and my finances Tom would say why are you wasting your time on your emailing your
1:33:48
finances if you're really good at streaming pay somebody to do that [ __ ] why the [ __ ] would waste your [ __ ]
1:33:55
time doing something you're not that good at it's not even making that much money for you you can make way more money just stream more pay somebody else
1:34:00
to do it like oh [ __ ] Tom good good idea you're right United States of America hi
1:34:07
um we have highly productive labor we're really good at like last stage of assembly on products and we lead the
1:34:13
world in Tech and AI that is true but uh do you guys like
1:34:19
manufacture widgets well no but we just like buy the widgets from somewhere else [ __ ] that why the [ __ ] we hold on okay pause it for a second you thought about
1:34:26
all right so this is where it gets very interesting treating the government like
1:34:32
a business has wild downsides so cue
1:34:37
anybody freaking out but wait that's what Trump and Elon are doing yep so this is where
1:34:43
um nailing down somebody's base assumptions is very important if you take my base assumption to be that I
1:34:51
believe that we are in a potential headlong Collision or headon collision with China that they control too much of
1:34:58
our manufacturing base that not controlling our manufacturing base puts us in a weakened position that we are
1:35:03
racing towards THD trap meaning China and America right now have a gravitational pull to
1:35:10
fight if we are going to fight China cannot control our manufacturing therefore even though I get what he
1:35:16
means by comparative advantage in a company that is absolutely true but this is all about what is the outcome that
1:35:22
you want my expected out of allowing China to continue to manufacture essentially everything for the world
1:35:28
including us is that we are in a weakened position uh from a manufacturing standpoint on a whole host
1:35:34
of levels not the least of which is militarily we will therefore lose a
1:35:40
conflict with China certainly just to keep it simple over Taiwan Taiwan as of
1:35:45
right now today controls chip manufacturing which is your entire modern way of life so once you
1:35:52
understand that as my base assumption then even though I get comparative advantage and hey it was a fun moment to
1:35:58
live through where we could disperse everything around the globe uh and let people specialize and they do the thing
1:36:05
that they specialize in we do the thing that we specialize in and everybody's happy the problem is that made China strong which created through CD's trap
1:36:12
and so as America has declined for a whole host of reasons not just because of globalism but protecting your Empire
1:36:18
becomes incredibly expensive so as America has declined and China Has Come On The Rise you set up the cidi Trap
1:36:25
where we are going to collide with China and I'm saying you've got to be prepared for that Collision so in a time where
1:36:32
globalism is the play yes you want everybody to specialize as you set up through the C's trap you cannot be in
1:36:38
that weekend position okay now I've talked extensively about Trump is playing a
1:36:45
game of chicken with the chaos that he's creating with across the board tariffs and I don't know if in the long run we
1:36:50
will be better off or worse off we will find out but you must bring some
1:36:55
manufacturing back to the US and for the reasons that I just talked about and the fact another base assumption that I have
1:37:01
that deaths of Despair among young men are largely due to the fact that there is a large cohort of American men that
1:37:07
are not going to find white color jobs and if there's no bluecollar jobs for them to have you create a very big
1:37:14
problem and so another way that you solve that is by bringing manufacturing back to the US okay so there it is
1:37:21
that's my take push back no I'm I'm formulating my
1:37:27
question because I think that having the government run by a
1:37:33
businessman isn't he taking a business as a government perspective but you think when it comes to tariffs and this
1:37:39
specific case there's greater implication so that's why it's an exception I'm saying that you can draw
1:37:46
the parallel to business forever if you want but you've got to come back out to 30,000 feet and say okay what makes
1:37:53
makes a business work what makes a business work is you have a desired outcome that you state you hold everybody accountable to kpis and you
1:38:00
try a thing I call it the physics of progress and you see did it move the kpi in the direction that we wanted it to
1:38:06
move running government like that makes all the sense in the world now as you drill in to treating a government as a
1:38:14
onetoone with a a company you start getting things like in a company you do want comparative advantage I don't want
1:38:20
you doing things within the company that you don't do well I would rather you specialize and then I've got somebody
1:38:26
else in the company that specializes in that other thing uh and you each do what you specialize in so he was talking
1:38:32
about this with um one of the things that you always advise a young entrepreneur to do is how much time are you spending on things that you're not
1:38:38
good at that somebody else could do that you could throw money at accounting bookkeeping becomes like the first one where people just waste a lot of time
1:38:45
and so you say okay don't do that and he uses a great example uh Destiny you're really good at streaming go do the
1:38:51
streaming let an accountant hand handle the book keeping the thing that you do that generates money is a streaming go do more of that 100% when you start
1:38:58
talking about a country where you have global politics at play where you have a potential war between you and another
1:39:04
country you have to say that is an end state that you want to protect against so if you come back out to the 30,000
1:39:10
foot View and you say okay uh physics of progress known end state known kpi so
1:39:17
I'm saying one of the kpis is you have to be able to control your military manufacturing we don't do that right now
1:39:24
because the future of military is largely drones China basically controls all drones this is way oversimplified
1:39:29
but we'll give you an example of what I'm talking about yeah so now even though China is far more efficient at
1:39:36
creating drones than we are we have an obligation to protect ourselves from a
1:39:41
future military conflict that's largely drones and controlled by China you don't want to be in that position just like if
1:39:48
we were about to go to war with Canada I would not that want them controlling our electricity so even if they can Supply it along the northern border for cheaper
1:39:56
than we can if I knew that we were going to be in a potential conflict I mean insert Israel and Gaza Gaza should
1:40:03
control its own electricity 100 per. you should immediately go I can't have these people who are wildly antagonistic
1:40:08
towards us controlling our electricity that's [ __ ] crazy so we've got to find a way to completely wean ourselves
1:40:13
off of them now people are going to argue that there's reasons why they can't whatever just you get the concept
1:40:18
so if you use business where
1:40:23
the people work for you and therefore you can do the specialization across the
1:40:29
country uh sorry across the company uh that you have other companies if you can
1:40:36
trust them to continue to supply you which Speaking from experience you can't always when we were small we couldn't
1:40:43
trust that other companies wouldn't try to choke off our access to protein therefore we've got to make sure that we
1:40:48
diversify that we've got it coming from multiple sources so um
1:40:55
depending on the level of analysis you can parallel countries and companies if you're not careful you will start making
1:41:02
decisions that don't make sense when you try to try to draw a one for one
1:41:09
parallel period Tom could you now what is what I want chat with the hardest thing the Tom
1:41:16
is the dumbest like I want to hear what that criticism is so there's um bubbling could you clarify the what kind of
1:41:23
manufacturing jobs should we bring back because there's in the chat people saying it's going to take us time to
1:41:29
onboard them and by the time that time comes robotics AI is going to like automate most of those and also I think
1:41:36
um destiny oh meaning the deaths of Despair part it won't solve that problem you said bring back manufacturing some
1:41:42
manufacturing jobs back to the States so like what kind of what kind of manufacturing jobs because let's take
1:41:49
the easiest one anything that has to do with military defense so if it has to do
1:41:54
with um weapons you immediately weapons and modern way of life those would be
1:42:00
the two biggest ones so anything to do with chips Electronics etc etc uh batteries cell phone parts that gets you
1:42:08
into the rare earth minerals anything that has to do with weapons manufacturing all of that uh
1:42:14
anything in robotics um and you're almost certainly not going to onshore
1:42:21
all of it you're going to onshore and friend Shore uh China is not your ally
1:42:27
right now so China is Russia in the 80s maybe not quite escalated to that but
1:42:32
it's getting close so if you think of them like that you're going to be in a much better position than if you assume
1:42:38
oh that they're friendly and everything is going to be great it's not all right and chat if that doesn't
1:42:44
answer the question or you have a specific challenge remember I want to get smarter so I want to know the place
1:42:50
where people think that I'm absolutely crazy Thomas basically saying onshore everything um Martin if we could onshore
1:42:59
everything great but we both know that you're going to run into realities on the ground and so there are going to be
1:43:06
things that we are going to frore so if you want to oversimplify my stance oversimplify it in the following way
1:43:13
don't let China who is increasingly your enemy don't let China be able to choke
1:43:18
you out from anything that matters yeah Martin that is a very good question
1:43:25
and right now people that I would consider historically very strong allies of the US it's all being called into
1:43:30
question because of the way that Trump is acting and that's why I say this level of chaos that Trump creates not
1:43:36
ideal um I think you will see it settle out to be Canada Mexico Europe
1:43:44
um obviously Israel potentially Saudi Arabia as we
1:43:49
move forward but I don't know about that one yet um those are your rough there
1:43:55
are more but those are the rough ones that I'll see that I think you will
1:44:02
see continue to be allies even after all of the chaos we'll see
1:44:07
though uh April it is my pleasure I appreciate that very much uh just keep
1:44:13
in mind I will not always get things right but I will update my thinking as we go so Tom please call Trump uh out
1:44:20
for harassing our allies R is maybe not the right person chat what do you think do I call out
1:44:26
Trump for harassing our allies I feel like I've said it in the last five minutes uh and have said it many times
1:44:32
in the podcast before but I believe it so if people don't feel that I address
1:44:38
that enough I happy to continue to push that all right assuming these are
1:44:44
answers to my question we've got a couple yeses anyway so anyway Trump is creating chaos that chaos is the shoot
1:44:51
me in the ear Theory I think it's absolute Madness um maybe it goes well maybe it goes absolutely [ __ ] terribly if you've
1:44:57
ever heard me say he's playing chicken that's what I'm talking about he's playing chicken uh which is not wise in my opinion what benefit does calling him
1:45:04
out have Stephen I think the reason I want to call him out is I want people to
1:45:11
understand I am trying to steer by one thing and one thing only and that is uh
1:45:17
what way of thinking behaving etc etc has high predictive validity to getting
1:45:22
you a desired outcome when I see anybody doing something that I don't think has high predictive validity then I'm going
1:45:28
to speak up that's what I ultimately want uh this community to Champion is a
1:45:35
way of thinking that is not tribally based that is kpi based quite frankly and that any of us will update our
1:45:41
thinking based on we run an experiment it does not yield the outcome that we wanted and therefore we go okay cool we're a little bit smarter now because
1:45:47
we know that way of approaching things does not work um or certainly doesn't have the level of efficiency that we
1:45:53
might want it to have and so in what way can we think that we'll have the level of efficiency that we want to have all
1:46:00
right people are calling out uh super chats so is this your self-imposed Exile
1:46:07
bot bottom of the hour I I told him that 9:45 let's do Super Chat recap all right here we go oh lza let's go can't wait to
1:46:15
hear that one all right in order will of uh cost I see
1:46:21
2001 oh you don't see this interesting he's just talking to me anyway it doesn't matter uh so whoever is
1:46:29
controlling that Eric if it's you yeah go back to G Paul we'll start with G Paul because he he did four back to back
1:46:34
at the top uh Buddha attained Nirvana via Detachment Jesus taught relinquishing
1:46:42
possessions zalu simpli lau lau Simplicity through to n Uber mench Uber
1:46:49
mench transcended old values each overcame limits you you see humans as inherently Primal
1:46:56
or political yet rouso and maslo argue naturally compassionate cooperative and
1:47:01
altruistic corrupted by societal structures Neuroscience reveals were biologically wired for empathy altruism
1:47:08
and connection under supportive conditions does capitalism obscure rather than nurture this potential um so
1:47:15
I think that any system can derange so there's no doubt that capitalism because
1:47:21
it acknowledges the um competition that you really can end up
1:47:27
in a winner take all scenario and so this is where government becomes incredibly useful that you can stop people from the worst of their impulses
1:47:34
basically which is to build a coalition of people uh that can ice everybody else
1:47:40
out and that ultimately ends up being bad for competition and so we call that Anti-Trust laws and I think those are
1:47:47
good I think you want that because ultimately you want what protects the consumer uh so I think the only way to
1:47:55
understand man is to understand man as the product of evolution that context matters a lot and when everybody's
1:48:01
getting along people treat people in one way and when everything is going wrong they treat people in a different way I
1:48:08
beseech you guys please read um the rise and fall of the Third Reich the gulg
1:48:14
archipelago ma the untold story the red famine Tombstone if you read those five
1:48:19
books the glimpse into what humans are capable of when things are going wrong
1:48:25
will be terrifyingly eye openening the most important you when you read the
1:48:31
book hold two people's ideas in mind number one is um Alexander soljan niten
1:48:38
and the other is Jordan Peterson Alexander Soulja niton said the line between good and evil runs through every
1:48:44
human heart I think that is very important to remember and then Jordan Peterson put forward the idea when you
1:48:51
think back in history don't imagine yourself as the person that hides Anne Frank in your addict as the vast
1:48:58
majority of people did not imagine yourself as the Nazi guard who loves his job that is excruciatingly eye openening
1:49:06
to be like yo humans myself included are capable of that [ __ ] and I have to protect against that like you guys
1:49:12
paying attention what's happening in Syria this is crazy so there was a guy I'm at the headline level I've watched
1:49:18
enough videos though to it really makes me actually sick to my stomach it is a darkness that [ __ ] I do not enjoy um but
1:49:27
if the headline can be believed there was a guy who refused to take his cross off refused to renounce Christianity and
1:49:34
for that he was beheaded and I thought [ __ ] what would I do in that situation
1:49:40
would I be like bro my wife pressured me to wear this I don't really believe this get the [ __ ] out of here um or because
1:49:48
like because there is trust me there are arguments to be made that that is a far more sensible solution if you want to
1:49:53
spread the word of Christ uh that you would lie in that moment and you would go do your thing the other is to say no
1:49:59
I'm going to be a martyr I'm going to be an example and I'm going to show that there are things that are worth dying for and I think you can make a very
1:50:05
compelling case on either side of those I would highly advise you to decide what you would do in that moment long before
1:50:11
that moment arises uh so if you understand humans
1:50:18
capitalism communism socialism any of the isms if if you understand all of
1:50:24
those through the lens of that reality humans are contextually based I think
1:50:30
you'll be in a much better off position this is why I don't trust my own emotions uh I do not think that the
1:50:38
higher level me that I when I say me is what I mean I don't think that my emotions have
1:50:46
that higher level me's best interests at heart certainly not all the time I think emotions are a way of making a highly
1:50:53
chaotic unknowable World navigable because emotions give you the impulse to
1:50:59
act and I think taking action is incredibly important period and then for the fourth part of
1:51:06
that giv your success my unconscious bias reinforce capitalism as optimal could achievements create a ego-driven
1:51:12
identity making capitalism difficult to question or transcend you kind of answer that with yeah I mean that that goes
1:51:18
with my um you do need government to protect you from the
1:51:25
distortions that are inevitable to arise in capitalism because humans will act
1:51:31
selfishly and oddly enough that's actually really powerful most of the time but every now and then it becomes
1:51:37
really problematic I'll round it to uh antitrust you do not want people to control the entire um industry that that
1:51:45
is bad for consumers so yeah you do need checks and balances all right Patrick
1:51:50
riton just finished Edward Fishman episode many good points but his comfort with cbdcs was absolutely horrific full
1:51:57
stop you and I agree so this comes back to base assumptions so Edward fish Fishman's base assumption is either uh
1:52:04
that people should be watched over and Draconian ruled financially which is
1:52:11
exactly what will happen with the cbdc or uh he has a base assumption that
1:52:16
people in government would never abuse that power so either of those to me are very problematic but nonetheless um
1:52:25
people are going to see it the way they're going to see it and rather than try to convince everybody I would say take them as a data point uh and if you
1:52:31
disagree word you have a uh you have a worldview as long as you are open to
1:52:37
change based on evidence of believing that either works or doesn't work you're in great shape yep and then this was the
1:52:43
last one from J K Tom Step One not recognizing that you you can't even be seen because opportunity is everything
1:52:50
90% of men are invisible men G continues to give women the tools to
1:52:55
exploit and Excel the men and expect I guess the men to hunt where men have to cast a net and fish think social media
1:53:02
water gun emoji phone emoji that was a now what thing you kind of said last time too a thousand per. I mean but let
1:53:11
hey our boy Jake is is coming in hot with these contributions so Jake thank you I I will definitely restate the
1:53:17
point um and now what right what are you going to do so that is the world you've
1:53:22
got two choices you can be an activist and you can um essentially do what I'm trying to do here since I'm already in a
1:53:29
relationship uh I'm trying to get people to change their frame of reference to recognize that the frame of reference
1:53:34
that exists right now is not super useful the other thing is now given that that is the world how do you win in that
1:53:40
world I just don't advise that you throw your hands up and say well it is what it is so I'm going to check out uh
1:53:47
understanding you're probably going to remain invisible when you are in uh a social media um zone so let's get out of
1:53:56
that so how do we meet people in the real world where do we find people um that are going to be likely to share our
1:54:02
values that we're likely to have interests in common so that we can then display ourselves at our best and where are you at your best and how do you put
1:54:09
yourself in a Zone where you can be at your best and then attract somebody uh based on that so this is one where I'd
1:54:17
have to know way more about your specific circumstances to understand exactly how to play that out uh but if I
1:54:23
were in that situation I would be meeting people in real life I would be putting myself in in a place where I can Excel I would be interested in them uh
1:54:30
so that they will find me interesting but I'm going to do a lot of work around that so uh figuring out how to ask
1:54:36
questions that are engaging that actually yield the answers that I'm looking for all of that so I'm still
1:54:41
going to focus the vast majority of my time on being somebody that is uh leveled up to the point that I can win
1:54:47
in the game I'm not personally going to spend my time fighting back against what
1:54:53
the rules of the game are other people can do that that's fine uh but if I were in it I would just be figuring out how I win and to win I've got to get a woman
1:55:01
who either already shares my perspective or uh to pull somebody out of their
1:55:06
perspective because most people have not spent a lot of time thinking about it's pretty easy to disrupt somebody's frame of reference that's a lie it's pretty
1:55:14
easy to get somebody to reveal that they don't understand their own values that actually is
1:55:21
true okay all right next up we got Preston Maloney uh going to try again I would like to try to advocate for my
1:55:27
solution to Ai and economy in this short video start at 55 Link in disc YouTube won't let me post here I posted the
1:55:34
video in dis in uh YouTube for uh visibility it is 10 minutes long so
1:55:39
press and we're going to have to check it out and we can resp do you have a a thumbnail sketch of it I I have he just
1:55:45
dropped it and got I'll have to like really dive into yeah yeah guys um it's a great hack to try to get us to play
1:55:52
your video but for stuff like that that takes longer to digest if you can just give us like a quick uh recap that would
1:55:59
help a lot and then we can respond quickly versus um Sid stepping or
1:56:04
sidetracking the whole uh live that all right and it's aoo Hall
1:56:10
friend of the chat nice to see you again think you want some basic things to be a government shared Monopoly such as fresh
1:56:15
clean water here in US make it as efficient a service as possible um
1:56:22
do we want the government to have a monopoly on certain things almost certainly yes there are some things that
1:56:28
are better left in the hands of the government uh fresh water strikes me as a great one so yeah I'm on board with
1:56:34
that all right Victor say we got to hold people accountable to results Like Flint Michigan right now was like [ __ ] what
1:56:39
yeah uh I don't want the government in charge of the water uh so we do have to be thoughtful about accountability and
1:56:45
that's why I am so twigged out by people being weird about Doge it's like you should want to know what are they doing
1:56:51
where are they spending their money and if they're spending a ton of money on the water infrastructure in Flint and yielding those results everybody needs
1:56:57
to cry foul 100% Victor Santos starting today I'll begin to give credit to my
1:57:02
wife thank you for the reminder I realized that when we first met I did not check any boxes there you go Victor let's go let's go I like it man making
1:57:11
marriage is better one marriage at of time great again that's what we're here for although apparently the chat chat
1:57:19
wants that confined not too much talk about relationships did I read the moment right we just went on too long no
1:57:25
no it was good there was just some people that were like our headlines about Ukraine
1:57:30
anded up yeah but it it was fluctua it was fluctu it came back um lucky Serita
1:57:35
thank you for the 499 Super Chat Tom you are big on Free Speech I agree but curious of your thoughts on Trump threatening protesters anding 100 plus
1:57:42
words from yeah how do we not talk so okay we at pull pull up a clip do we have a clip I think oh we need a clip we
1:57:49
need a clip Drew we need a clip uh if we don't have a clip here's what I will say free speech is one of the most
1:57:56
important things in the world and um the guy uh Mahmud mmud I think his name is
1:58:03
something like that um if he has not done anything that violates the
1:58:11
definition of free speech as the US government has laid it out then I say you protect the life out of that and
1:58:16
free speech is about letting people say things that you think are abor so as long as it doesn't uh become a call for
1:58:22
violence etc etc whether that person is a citizen or not I think people should be protected with free speech laws now
1:58:29
having said that I think that immigration is a very important question to get right I think we do have a
1:58:36
culture I think we want to acknowledge that America has a culture and I think you want to absolutely avoid with
1:58:41
aggression bringing people in and not expecting them to assimilate you do not want to invite
1:58:47
multiculturalism as very different from being a mult multi ethnic culture
1:58:52
multiethnic cultures yay love but if you're coming to America you should be coming here to become American as I
1:58:58
would be if I moved to Japan I'd be going to Japan to embrace Japanese culture otherwise I should stay in
1:59:03
America so uh I feel very strongly that if if you are talking about who are the
1:59:09
people that we are going to invite into the country uh who are the people that we're going to give citizenship to yeah I'm totally here for uh people saying
1:59:16
this is not even though they're protected by Free Speech this is not somebody that we want to give a green card to this is not somebody that we
1:59:22
want to become a citizen uh because they do not Embrace American values yeah cool here for that um but having people say
1:59:30
whatever they believe to be true as long as it doesn't violate the things that the United States Supreme Court has already um rendered a verdict on that's
1:59:37
crazy to me that would be a huge mistake um and a federal judge has
1:59:42
blocked Trump's attempt to from deporting the green card holder and palestinia activists mmud khil he was
1:59:49
the one who led the protest at Columbia University word so now it becomes a question of what can you do uh what
1:59:55
legal standing would you use if you want to not give somebody like that
2:00:01
citizenship the way that Lisa and I think about this in the company is everything needs to be done at the policy level so don't do anything
2:00:07
specifically about this guy just say this is what's true about green cards these are the people that we're going to give citizenship to if you meet these
2:00:13
qualifications whether you're saying things that I don't like or not is totally irrelevant uh th this is the
2:00:19
standard for a green card to get a green card this is the standard for going from Green Card to citizenship and then
2:00:25
either he meets those qualifications or he doesn't you should not be targeting people that you think I [ __ ] hate
2:00:31
their views um that is a mistake that is quickly how you go all right the
2:00:36
president gets to decide um what qualifies for a thing that can be said and can't be said that that is
2:00:43
absolutely a path to ruin yeah that was a tough one um all right that tough why is that tough the
2:00:51
immigration side is way tougher for me the free speech side is easy immigration hard if call for violence no yeah if
2:00:58
saying thing I hate yes as long as you're not calling for violence so if this guy's saying down with America capitalism's evil this should be a
2:01:05
communist country um all Christians uh should repent and should um convert to
2:01:12
Islam cool if you say all Christians should be killed problem there's that
2:01:19
line it's just the thing of policing protesters and there's no everybody
2:01:26
wants free speech until it's something that you don't want to be said yeah exactly this is why uh I think it was
2:01:32
the um ACL please fact check me but this was in the 60s or 70s the ACL stood up
2:01:40
for the clan right to march in a town in
2:01:45
where Consin somewhere in Middle America where there were a bunch of concentration camp survivors and the
2:01:52
clan wanted to March or the neo-nazis what whatever they were they they were
2:01:57
very uh anti-jewish and they fought for their right to be able to do that March
2:02:04
because they said even though we think that their beliefs are abor they have the right to say it dude I'm still on that bandwagon let people say what they
2:02:11
believe to be true because I want to be able to say what I believe to be true and if one government is saying oh these
2:02:18
are the bad guys I know when they get voted out of power which they will and the other group comes in I might become
2:02:23
the bad guy so I want the people that I believe are the bad guys to be able to say whatever the [ __ ] they want as long as it doesn't violate the things that
2:02:29
the Supreme Court has already ruled on and I the the impulse to silence people
2:02:35
is so misguided and I get it it's strong but your your government is not going to be in power forever and so you should
2:02:43
want a system that when the roles are reversed protects you full stop full stop but the
2:02:51
immigration one that gets trickier should this guy be allowed to become a citizen should he be allowed to keep his green card woof that gets a lot tougher
2:02:59
that gets a lot tougher because you do not want to invite a bunch of people into your country who hate the values
2:03:04
that your culture stands for that to me is bad mojo yeah that is very unwise all
2:03:10
right Insight junkie thank you for the 10 pound Super Chat uh over the last few years 10 euro uh 10 euro super chat over
2:03:17
the last few years I've seen everyone since making apparatus break on issues close to them Sam Harris Gad Jordan
2:03:23
Peterson how have you stayed so levelheaded I find it hard to do okay so first of all thank you
2:03:30
obviously there are going to be a lot of people that don't think I'm level-headed so just full acknowledgement to that uh it largely comes out of a distrust of my
2:03:37
own emotions so when I find myself having a strong emotion I have built a value system that says ooh the thing
2:03:44
that you think you are most sure about is the thing that you should worry the most about uh so what is the thing that
2:03:49
I put the most time and energy into checking uh uh inflation because that is the thing that I have the highest
2:03:54
conviction on so I am constantly like what am I missing here now remember I will fight for my idea largely as a way
2:04:00
to test the veracity of that belief but don't confuse me going ham even if I'm
2:04:06
yelling and screaming it's because that one I find if I don't dial up the rhetoric I don't get people that are
2:04:12
trying to poke holes in my rhetoric so I just want to know what actually works
2:04:18
because I took myself from broke to wealthy and when I looked back I was like wait this was all an echo of me
2:04:23
changing the set of ideas that I chose to believe in that in the way that Drew was radicalized by understanding it
2:04:29
takes 37,000 years to spend a million dollars a day and that's how much we collect in taxes every year uh I was
2:04:35
radicalized by realizing that oh my God I was headed nowhere fast based on a set
2:04:41
of ideas and I completely changed my life by changing the set of ideas that I chose to believe I was like what the [ __ ] uh it you feel like you're waking
2:04:49
up out of the Matrix and you want to go grab everybody and be like hey you're asleep but if you can believe these
2:04:55
things it will actually change the course of your life but one of the things that I believe is that I can't trust my emotions uh one of the things
2:05:01
that I believe is that oh God I'm likely to be wrong one of the things that I believe is that um skills have utility
2:05:08
and that you can get good at something and that will manifest in the world as an ability to reach a desired outcome uh
2:05:13
one of the things that I believe is that the only way to get better is to aggressively try something be willing to admit when you're wrong and then go ooh
2:05:21
uh don't value myself for being right value myself for identifying the right answer the right answer as defined by
2:05:27
what has predictive validity and so when you live in that I don't get trapped lies I'm trapped in my
2:05:35
ego but my ego is built around identifying the right answer not being
2:05:41
right okay now I think Sam Harris who is the one that I I think I can most
2:05:48
understand where you're coming from where is what is Sam trapped
2:05:57
by I I don't think Sam is trapped by needing to be consistent I really don't I think Sam is trapped by his own
2:06:04
beliefs and values and so he has a belief that Trump is a con man that
2:06:13
Trump will lead us somewhere negative and that if in fact here here is the
2:06:19
belief that leads Sam I can't believe I'm having to ReDiscover this as I've talked about it so many times the belief
2:06:25
that has led Sam into a problematic corner is that he can trust himself and
2:06:31
because he believes he can trust himself he has built a worldview that he's just like um since I know I can trust myself
2:06:39
and there are other people like me meaning other people of my intellectual caliber uh that there should be Elites
2:06:46
that we need institutions that are stable and that they are staffed with
2:06:51
the brightest people in the world and that those bright people can be trusted to be moral and to do the right thing
2:06:57
and Donald Trump is a threat to those institutions once you have that as your backdrop of how Sam Harris thinks he'll
2:07:04
make sense to you because anything that is a wrecking ball to those institutions he's going to have a problem with uh if
2:07:10
an institution has to lie and frame things in a way to get people to do the thing that's good for them he's okay
2:07:15
with that so I have a because I have a fundamental belief that I am fallible that I'm likely to be wrong that by the
2:07:22
way every human no matter how smart is fallible is likely to be wrong uh
2:07:27
therefore you always want them to be checked and questioned it's what I call the dumb voter problem everybody
2:07:34
believes somebody to be dumb how do you want them to be treated I want them to be able to say whatever
2:07:40
they believe to be true even if I think that they are too dumb to say a smart thing like they're so dumb there's no
2:07:45
Universe in which they will ever be right they are always going to say the wrong thing because I don't trust my ability to accurately assess everyone
2:07:52
I'm just like just let everybody say what they want to say uh Sam does not have that same belief now without imping
2:08:00
the other people I will say some people just have a tribal mindset and so they
2:08:05
want to say things that their side likes and they probably really do just have
2:08:11
that strong impulse that lines up with a tribe and so between already feeling
2:08:17
that way not questioning their own emotions and getting posit feedback from their Community it tends to
2:08:24
escalate period period uh okay Michael
2:08:29
MC G thank you for the fiveyear old Super Chat do you think fiveyear old five year old you're that makes a lot
2:08:35
more sense do you think the US is now an oligarchy especially now regarding Zuck Bezos Brin backing Trump and Elon now a
2:08:42
massive leverage over everything okay so oligarchy if you look up the definition just means rule by the few every
2:08:47
government is ruled by the few there is no way to avoid oligarchy uh I think plutarchy is ruled by the
2:08:54
rich there is a name for it if it's not um plutarchy or something like that uh
2:09:01
forgive me but uh do I think that we are rule by the wealthy yeah
2:09:06
plutocracy okay so are we a plutocracy right now in the Trump
2:09:12
government the few that are ruling us definitely skew wealthy so that is
2:09:17
probably a good way to think about it now the question becomes um what oligarchy do we want in power do
2:09:26
we want wealthy people who have gotten Wealthy by being hyp successful because
2:09:31
another way to think about it is right now that the government is being wildly influenced by the most successful Among
2:09:37
Us I'm not saying that um all of them are amazing and there's no corruption
2:09:42
and you don't have to worry about that you should be super [ __ ] paranoid for corruption um however when I think about
2:09:49
who are the people that I would want to see in government having somebody like Howard letnik who has made gobs of money uh off of
2:09:58
understanding the economy and betting on its movements that would be amazing I'd probably rather have Rio just I have
2:10:04
more trust in Rio could just be my familiarity with him uh but Ray's
2:10:10
thinking to me is awesome now if you want to Target Ray you go after what he
2:10:15
thinks about China I'm not blind to that uh but I'd rather see that but if I
2:10:21
can't have Ray than having somebody like Howard lutnick who is just won over and over and over and over and over over and over uh having someone like Elon who is
2:10:27
the greatest capital allocator of our time go in and look at how the government is spending money love that
2:10:32
um I've always had mixed feelings about Trump I wish I could have voted for RFK Q Drew he did vote for RFK but he wasn't
2:10:39
on all the states ballots uh so that's where I come at that so um I
2:10:46
don't want corrupt wealthy people positioning
2:10:52
the government so that they can just get wealthier that I don't want I think that's absolutely terrible for the middle class and I think that there is a
2:10:58
suicidal um tendency towards ultra wealthy people who just want to see
2:11:03
themselves get wealthier to lose sight of the actual way that you get wealthy is by adding value to uh the lower
2:11:08
middle class just because they make up so much of the
2:11:14
population look I'm not blind to lvmh anyway I won't derail us but uh that is
2:11:19
on balance that is the right way to that is the shest way to getting wealthy this
2:11:25
is going back to our um Pro Hamas deportation question from Ed kisy let's
2:11:31
go uh thank you for the $5 Super Chat what if the guy supporting and promoting a group Hamas who wants the end of the
2:11:36
US yeah so this goes back to what what are we doing from an immigration standpoint I do not think you let me be
2:11:42
even harder Dear America don't invite Pro Hamas people into your country it is not a value set that serves America well
2:11:50
so uh you have to turn that into a policy and right now I believe the policy already states that if you
2:11:57
support a terrorist organization uh that you do not qualify for a green card or
2:12:02
citizenship the exact verbiage needs to be looked up I don't know it off the top my head but doing it at the policy level
2:12:09
like that makes a lot of sense to me but then you have to enforce that universally you cannot be selective you can't go I don't like what this guy is
2:12:16
doing at Columbia University and therefore I'm going to selectively uh boot this guy that's to me is an
2:12:21
absolute mistake is very corrupt and I get the impulse they can't trust it they
2:12:26
can't trust it because it will be used against you it will be used against you the Republicans are not going to be in
2:12:33
power forever and so if you set up a bunch of laws that serve you well but don't serve the other side well or
2:12:40
wouldn't serve you well when the other side is in power that is a mistake and I think that they are doing exactly that
2:12:47
if Trump is really saying that basically I Trump and Mark Rubio should be able to
2:12:52
selectively say yes this person no that person that is a catastrophic [ __ ] error
2:12:58
catastrophic slippery slope um Tyre die economy thank you for the 499 Super Chat
2:13:04
hey Tom instead of tariffs couldn't couldn't the government contract with domestic industry to boost capacity
2:13:10
using tax money less distorted Market question mark uh let me reread this make sure I
2:13:16
understand uh contract with so no you don't want the you don't want the
2:13:21
government picking winners and losers which they are doing right now this is all a big part of my tie raade about how
2:13:27
uh inflationary dollars make their way into the country I think it's a mistake
2:13:36
um I don't know that there's a clean way to do this how do you do this in a short
2:13:41
timeline okay you want to onshore manufacturing says Tom yes uh all of it
2:13:46
no but anything that has to do with our Modern Way of anything sensible that has to do with our modern way of life get
2:13:53
out of the clutches of China uh get militarily strong how do you do that in
2:13:59
a way that makes sense I don't know of a perfect way the
2:14:05
one two punch of tariffs and incentives via tax breaks is
2:14:14
probably the only time tested answer it's the only time tested answer that I'm aware of if there's a better one I
2:14:20
will adopt immediately but that is the time- tested way of doing this that I am currently aware of uh so yeah the way
2:14:29
that Trump is going about it though I think is is unduly unnecessarily chaotic
2:14:35
uh but time will tell I could be wrong about that so we will see how it plays out in the end but if you want to know
2:14:40
how I feel about it right now I think he is inviting an unnecessary level of chaos
2:14:46
um but we'll see he is moving the Overton window and he's moving it so radic Ally that may serve us but he's
2:14:53
moving the Overton window he's alienating our allies he's making Canada threaten to turn off the electricity it
2:14:59
is a level of short-term disruption that um I wouldn't invite if I were in his
2:15:06
position all right thank you everybody for the super chats we are jumping back into the episode Eric I queued up a new
2:15:12
uh video on slack let's talk future Tech I thought this was really cool um I've been kneee in a show called May
2:15:18
Kingstown also on Paramount um that is not as good it's a little bit gritty I don't know if you'll be into it this is Jeremy rener yeah um it was about like
2:15:27
the prison complex and the system and then we seen this link this past week about the meta putting Quest twos into
2:15:34
California prisons for inmates and solitary confinement um yep I thought it
2:15:40
was interesting that cuz I think our prison system is broken we talked about it briefly earlier like private prisons don't make sense to me but I think that
2:15:47
this is could be a positive way to reprogram is the wrong word but kind of help people rehabilitate themselves in a
2:15:54
cool way however it does look like a brainwashing uh cut scene from like a
2:16:00
dystopian future of people like sitting in solitary confinement with a headset on like what's your take on VR in the
2:16:05
prison system it's all going to be stats and the stats here are absolutely incredible now this is very early and who knows this is one person making a
2:16:12
claim but if these can be belied zoom in a little bit because it says right there um crazy part is that VR quote unquote
2:16:19
programming uh in with the VR programming inmate
2:16:24
infractions have fallen 96% um to explain why I think this is so
2:16:30
powerful and is the kind of thing that is very worth testing I don't know that it'll play out well in the long run
2:16:36
everything is a hypothesis it's all physics of progress uh State what's your goal we want to reduce recidivism we
2:16:42
want to dramatically decrease um violence of the inmates while they're in
2:16:47
prison as well Okay cool so let's say that that's our end goal uh and our hypothesis is that if we can
2:16:53
transport these people to a different world so that they um don't feel so isolated that they have like this
2:17:00
opportunity to be expansive all while we can influence the way that their brain is working to get them to make better
2:17:05
choices a lot of people uh that are in uh prison for violent crimes have
2:17:11
suffered brain damage and so there's like all this brain wiring stuff becomes a part of this mhm okay cool that's the
2:17:17
hypothesis that's the end goal we've got our kpis uh re ISM and uh violent
2:17:23
incursions while they're in prison cool so now we're going to pull the lever the reason that I think that this probably
2:17:29
will yield tremendous outcomes is the very first time I put on VR the emotional reaction I had was why am I
2:17:36
pursuing wealth and I was like whoa that is a very interesting insight into my
2:17:42
mind because I'd worked so hard uh cool house had always been something that drove me mhm and when I put VR on
2:17:51
and realized wait a second while I'm in VR I actually feel that I'm looking at
2:17:57
something real and so the Vista of a mountain range or whatever now feels
2:18:02
real and so imagine a world where either through VR AR glasses or Holograms
2:18:09
whatever you live in a tiny apartment in Manhattan but when you look at your windows which actually aren't windows
2:18:15
they're green screens uh they are or you know something you can turn on and off
2:18:21
they're now showing you a Vista so you're looking out your window and you see outer space or you're looking out your window and you see um Paris
2:18:29
whatever whatever your thing is and it feels real that that is going to have a
2:18:36
profound impact on somebody's psychology and for the same reason that you can get somebody to walk on a board that's only
2:18:41
2 inches off the ground but in VR they look like they're standing on a really small metal beam over a thot drop their
2:18:49
amydala lights up goes crazy and is screaming at them you really are in danger so the brain from an evolutionary
2:18:57
standpoint is designed to say I see it and it's real and therefore the amount
2:19:02
of positive or negative impact that we could have using VR reprogramming I think is going to be pretty extreme so
2:19:09
if we can all admit that them being in prison is an outcome that we do not want then we have to do something to
2:19:15
reprogram them and so you don't want that to be um something that is worse
2:19:21
for them you want it to be something that is better for them but yes I want to see people truly rehabilitated in
2:19:28
prison I want to see them educated I want to see them as much as we can um
2:19:34
humanely address whatever literal brain trauma they have that has led them to that place anything that we can do to
2:19:41
uplift the human spirit so that they are not they don't want to return to a life of crime which I get some people are just going to and that just is what it
2:19:47
is from a brain wiring standpoint but yeah anything we can do help I think it would be awesome yeah the weird thing
2:19:54
about it though is like the images that are on the VR set so right now I'm hoping that it's positive and they're only getting good things but it can also
2:20:00
get deranged really quick if they're like horor and they're like torturing people or I'm thinking like Minority
2:20:05
Report that black GE mirror episode where like the VR image is now manipulated to make that person suffer
2:20:11
as opposed to educate them yes that would be god- awful and that's why we
2:20:16
have rules against that kind of thing um obviously I don't want to see people do
2:20:23
um cruel and unusual punishment uh I don't want people tortured so whatever
2:20:28
the VR equivalent is of like they were saying the Bots you would feed them noise like I don't want them putting
2:20:34
them in VR in a way that's like horrible like you this is why you have to say what's the end goal and so if the end
2:20:40
goal is punishment well then that's going to be a very different VR but that's not the end goal that I want for
2:20:45
people um in fact that's really interesting it's not quite true there is
2:20:50
is a level of punishment but if I could do a thing that I knew 100% guaranteed
2:20:56
that that person would um embody deep
2:21:02
remorse and never do said bad thing again would I be
2:21:08
okay with it my immediate reaction is no so there's something I would have to process through uh because that's
2:21:13
probably a level of brain manipulation that triggers not probably that's a level of brain manipulation that triggers my the unknown second and third
2:21:19
order consequences me nervous yeah uh and so I would tread into those Waters slowly nice yeah things have to
2:21:26
withstand the test of time all right in in other news anthropic CEO the founder of Claude my AI talked about how coding
2:21:33
will reev AI will be the majority of coding in the very near future yeah like three to six
2:21:39
months all right we should be good now oh
2:21:44
God oops even I can't hear it so I'm guessing chat can't
2:21:54
all right chat just to invite you behind the scenes needless to say itive Advantage is
2:22:00
very now getting to kind of the job side of this um I do have a fair amount of
2:22:07
concern about this on one hand I think comparative advantage is a very powerful
2:22:12
tool if I look at program which is one area where AI is making the most
2:22:18
progress what we are finding we are not far from the world I think we'll be there in 3 to 6 months AI is writing 90%
2:22:26
of the code and then in 12 months we may be in a world where AI is writing
2:22:31
essentially all of the code now getting kind so assume that he's wrong about the timeline and it's
2:22:37
really in five years um the fact that AI is getting so good
2:22:43
at writing code which does not surprise me because this is a very defined outcome unlike creative writing where
2:22:50
it's like uh I want you to make me feel a certain way when I read it or when I see it animated or whatever that's
2:22:57
really squishy that's going to be really hard for AI to get good you just need a ton of patterns um for AI to get good at
2:23:05
coding there's a known it needs to run this it needs to do this thing and every time you code and go in and adjust that
2:23:11
code the AI is looking at that and going oh cool I see how to do this right I see how to do it right ah um that it's going
2:23:17
to get very good very fast I am surprised that people try to brush
2:23:25
off the level of disruption that AI is going to bring to the job market even though as an Act of Faith I choose to
2:23:32
believe that the future will be better than the present I recognize we will move through a period of massive
2:23:38
disruption and it would be very cold comfort for a middle-of the road programmer who right now can support
2:23:44
their family um they're going to get replaced by Ai and that's real and not having a
2:23:52
sense of what do we do about that this is where it's going to catch people off guard you're going to get that major push back because the emotional response
2:23:58
that people will have is [ __ ] Ai and then they're going to get very aggressive and they're going to Rally around the government to make changes
2:24:04
and if we're talking like if he's even remotely close and this happens in the next 18 months um dude people are going
2:24:12
to feel some kind of way about this you do not want to sweep this under the rug this is one that you want to say okay
2:24:17
what are we going to do here what are we going to do about this because this one's this one's going to be a wrecking ball so here's what I think that we do
2:24:23
about it uh dear everybody you are going to have to take control of your own life you are going to have to figure out how
2:24:29
not to get left behind by AI uh this is also part of the reason I want to onshore manufacturing there has to be an
2:24:35
off-ramp for people that are not going to be able to or have the desire to keep up with um the white color jobs that are
2:24:42
going to rapidly race away from them and we've got to have a way for people to have dignity meaning and purpose through
2:24:48
a trade of some kind so not everybody has to work in a factory but if we have this idea of we need to make things do
2:24:55
things here in the US I think it's orientationally more advantageous now will those jobs also be replaced by
2:25:01
robots many of them will for sure um and
2:25:06
that moves us into where I was going in the beginning which is you need to take control of your life you need to ask
2:25:12
yourself how can I use AI to make things that people want that I'm not going to be able to fold myself into a company in
2:25:18
the way that we've been able to do historically companies are going to become much smaller in scope from a
2:25:23
Personnel perspective more people are going to have to step into the role of not necessarily like an entrepreneur in
2:25:29
the way that we think about it now but you're going to become a part of a very small group that serves a very Niche
2:25:35
population I've talked about dropping the the world right now um the economic
2:25:41
world that we have right now is all these companies of all different sizes from very small to very large that's
2:25:47
going to break and it's going to be mostly a bunch of very small companies and then very large companies and I
2:25:53
think that the number of big companies that will that will shatter into uh
2:25:58
thousands of little pieces is going to be very extreme and so you need to uh
2:26:04
bone up on not being not needing somebody to tell you what to do you need to focus on becoming
2:26:10
self-directed um to shake off the notion of when the cats away the mice will play
2:26:15
there's not going to be anybody looking over your shoulder you're going to have to decide what outcome you're trying to achieve and you're going to have to
2:26:21
figure out how to get yourself there and for an education system that teaches people to be good cogs in the machine
2:26:27
this is going to be very disruptive uh bang drum for educational reform so
2:26:33
that's where we're at nice uh I feel like his timeline was off to be quite Frank cuz I feel like you saying five
2:26:41
years I think the year is is a better Mark by next year if everybody's not using AI especially in the software
2:26:47
engineering world you're just shooting yourself in your foot I feel like so I think I think I think it is true that everybody overestimates what you can do
2:26:53
in a year and you underestimate what you can do in three um yes yeah there there's no doubt now I will say that
2:27:00
he's very close to the problem uh so he's probably overly ambitious but I
2:27:07
if you're thinking as much Beyond 18 if you're a coder and you're thinking as much Beyond 18 months you're probably
2:27:13
making a mistake I would just right now today man just do it now and look listen I see this at impact Theory to the point
2:27:19
where the executive team is talking almost daily how do we get you guys to embrace AI now some people do but there
2:27:27
are other people in the the company that clearly there's an anxiety over it there is a desire to poo poo it and say but it
2:27:34
doesn't do it to my job is so nuanced AI is not going to be able to do it it's like bro that is just I get it as a
2:27:43
writer I'm looking at it going okay it doesn't get me all the way across the finish line but I'm constantly pushing
2:27:49
okay but how close can it get me how how much can it extend my abilities how much can it speed me up rather than lamenting
2:27:56
I'm not going to be sitting down and writing the way that I always thought I was going to be as a kid that that reality is gone
2:28:03
um if I could get people to distrust that anxiety and say the only path
2:28:09
forward is to embrace this incredible tool and I'm going to learn how to use it that that would be my ideal but it is
2:28:15
very hard to get people when they're scared to think clearly yeah and then we
2:28:21
have some new Robotics and some new trick moves Eric I just sent you the link for that um Tom and you just time
2:28:28
check for it's 10:30 we're running an experiment today will so we have all the way to 12: so we're g to go through
2:28:35
everything as if this were the live episode uh now it may tank in which case
2:28:42
we will take a different approach but we're going to run the experiment physical
2:28:47
progress all right this was I think this is probably the best walking robot I've seen so far
2:28:54
um it just seems so fluid and like it actually has the mechanics under it it doesn't seem like it's always about the fall or thinking too
2:29:01
much interesting he looks still very stilted but when I saw this stuff I was like oh damn like this is a bot that
2:29:08
knows how to control what are those things called hoverboards hoverboards yeah that's pretty impressive riding a bike very
2:29:14
impressive so now you don't need Bots that like are a bike you can get bots
2:29:22
that are able to adjust to the world the way that it is now which means that you don't have to abruptly build new
2:29:28
infrastructure for the Bots to be useful that's the part that I don't like if anybody's asking themselves why are they working so hard to make them humanoid
2:29:34
aren't they going to come in a bunch of other flavors yes over time they certainly will but right now you have
2:29:39
you know however many years of building infrastructure that assumes that you're a human with two legs and two arms and
2:29:44
so now if you've got a bot that can navigate that world you're in much better shape um so it is very
2:29:50
interesting thaw says new slave Force I hate that framing but yes it certainly
2:29:57
will be a new Workforce that is for sure speaking of Workforce thank you for the alleyoop uh Larry Fink had some words
2:30:05
for Trump about deportation uh and about this kind of goes back to our conversation at the last live where we
2:30:10
talked about can is it a problem where there's not enough American workers to take those jobs or do we actually need
2:30:17
immigrants to fill in the gaps in the American economy
2:30:22
all right is going to have severe impact I
2:30:30
do believe deportations in the speed of which this is happening is going to have severe impact on the agricultural sector
2:30:36
and the construction sector um I've talked to CEOs in in the EG sector and they remind me that 70% of the men and
2:30:44
women who work in the agriculture were not born in the United States many of them are US citizens now many of them
2:30:50
have work permits and many of them don't and 40% of the construction workers were
2:30:56
not born in the United States you add that up and what's going on I think we're going to start seeing especially
2:31:02
when spring and the spring crops arrive are we going to have enough workers to uh harvest the crops and um and now one
2:31:11
one of the most fascinating things to me about this era where we're able to see
2:31:17
all of these talks because they're posted on uh YouTube or X in this case
2:31:22
is that bro there are [ __ ] laws what's happening like this guy is literally just admitting yeah the way
2:31:28
the world works is we all just completely ignore the law and uh we want these people that come into America that
2:31:34
are working under the table for uh lower wages and may it better continue man I'm
2:31:40
over here warning Trump like bro you got to let these people stay even though they're illegal what the [ __ ] like this is where I'm like Hey by all means go
2:31:48
advocate for different policies go to the American people and say dear American people we don't believe that you're going to take these jobs and
2:31:54
therefore we're going to increase immigration from places where we think we'll get a generation of really cheap
2:31:59
labor and you guys are going to love it you're going to benefit from it and let the American people go either [ __ ] you or yep we're here for it but this is
2:32:05
nuts this like quiet behind the scenes like well everybody knows that you know these are all being done by illegal immigrants like what the [ __ ] policies
2:32:13
people policies like get the policies that you believe in that you're willing to stand up for and say yes this is the
2:32:18
policy like it's B bananas that we want like look laws are enforced selectively
2:32:24
if someone is rushing their wife to the hospital and they are driving fast I would want the cops to show up and be like hey get behind us we're going to
2:32:30
get you there and make sure that your baby's safe so there is a difference between the spirit of the law and the letter of the law but when you start
2:32:35
scaling that [ __ ] it's like bro like just say what it is like say what the
2:32:41
thing is and let people decide this is that whole Elite mentality of like all
2:32:46
right we're going to have some laws on the books but we know what's actually best for America and you guys are going to be good like that's crazy town so we
2:32:55
are in a competition right now where basically what we're saying to the world is uh do you want really cheap [ __ ] or
2:33:01
do you want to be able to work for a living that's it because if you don't
2:33:07
let cheap labor into the country then you have options option one we're going to import our fruit from other places
2:33:13
and we say yeah we really aren't willing to do these jobs so we're going to now Outsource that kind of stuff put yourself in a very dicey position
2:33:19
because now you don't make your own food yikes don't love that but it's an option um option number two is we don't let
2:33:26
these people in the country and um Now farmers like uh [ __ ] I'm going to have
2:33:31
to pay more money to get people to come deal with my crops or honestly what I think would happen is you would see
2:33:38
investments into Innovation that would allow us to drive the cost down and this is why when you create these distortions
2:33:44
in the market um distortions in this case being allowing illegal people to
2:33:49
come in and do it for Less you don't get the Innovation The Innovation here is turning a blind eye
2:33:56
to illegal immigrants mhm I would just say either get people to say yeah I want
2:34:01
this stuff to be cheap and I want to do it by importing immigrants then don't make it illegal just say this is what it
2:34:08
is and let people in but if you're not willing to say what you're actually doing like this is nuts queen says I
2:34:14
ain't going back in the fields Queen fair enough do your thing nobody is forcing you or any body else it this is
2:34:21
how economies work but I'm just saying do it all out in the open Infinite
2:34:27
Warfare spelled different uh do people like jobs I don't know what just
2:34:34
happened something like that do cows like eating grass what's happening uh G I just like the link to
2:34:40
you if you can pull that one up all right and now moving on to international news Ukraine has agreed to a 30-day
2:34:47
ceasefire um and this is on the backs of zalinsky Vance scuffle that happened um
2:34:54
so I'm glad that we were able to kind of resolve and find something back to peace um we had a video that uh Mark Rubio did
2:35:01
a press conference for CNN we have that coverage today we made an offer that the
2:35:07
ukrainians have accepted which is to enter into a ceasefire and into immediate uh negotiations to end this
2:35:14
conflict in a way that's enduring and sustainable and accounts for their interest their security their ability to
2:35:19
Prosper as a nation I I want to personally thank we both want to thank the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia his majesty
2:35:25
for hosting us for making this possible they've been instrumental in this process and we're very grateful to them for hosting us here today and and
2:35:31
hopefully we'll we'll take this offer now to the Russians and we hope that they'll say yes that they'll say yes to peace the ball is now in their court and
2:35:38
um but again the president's objective here is number one above everything else he wants the war to end and I think
2:35:45
today Ukraine has taken a concrete step in that regard we hope the Russians will reciprocate today we made an offer that
2:35:51
the ukrainians have accepted which is to enter into a closer yeah we're about to find out if Russia is going to create a
2:35:59
problem because they've really stood on there will be no ceasefire um so they want like a proper
2:36:05
negotiated settlement period end of story this is where we're at and this is now done um so we'll see it it will be
2:36:12
very interesting to see what I like is this paints Trump into a corner about now are you just going to back Russia
2:36:19
and like well you know having further looked at this actually the deal that we got um Ukraine to agree to that wasn't
2:36:26
really great God if he does that like that really is a signal that homeboy is just batting for Russia uh but if he's
2:36:33
like what the [ __ ] like Russia's been offered something they really should take we're going to start pressuring them like they are now acting in bad
2:36:40
faith it'll be telling we're going to see he did have that tweet a couple days ago where he was talking tough to Russia
2:36:46
saying that they need to chill we got the negot on on board so with with all
2:36:52
signs pointing it does seem like the ball is in Russia's Court to end this war if they want to well the ball's always been in their Court in terms of
2:36:58
they could end the war at any moment the question is now that Ukraine has said
2:37:04
okay this is actually something that will take does Russia come to the table and go okay cool like we're close let's really negotiate this out and since I
2:37:10
can see that this is close let's agree to a ceasefire um or do they go not we're either going to get everything we
2:37:16
want or everybody can [ __ ] right off and then it's like okay now we know where we're at now somebody just said something about a
2:37:21
drone attack I've been watching some of those fpv drone attack vids from Ukraine oh when we scroll
2:37:28
off scroll back please uh stop stop y Robert yeah uh
2:37:36
been watching some of the fpv Drone attack vids from Ukraine and it seems to me that Ukraine might be broadcasting
2:37:42
their own own war crimes I even saw them blow up a van full of injured Russians
2:37:48
can't comments very very possible bro do we ever get out of War without war crimes I doubt
2:37:53
it I doubt it fpv I'm peep pulling killing killing when somebody kills your
2:37:59
friend you about to do anything vladus what did that
2:38:05
say ooh I don't even know if we can show this on YouTube sheesh no you can't if
2:38:12
it's people getting blown up yes dude oh have you seen the stuff coming out of
2:38:17
Syria I haven't yikes all right this was not me encouraging you to look it up but
2:38:24
whoa what is happening does anybody have links in the chat this is we got one more funny thing for the end but this is
2:38:30
now I'm throwing it into chat if you guys have anything that's on your radar something that you think is is is popping off let us know in the chat any
2:38:37
links drop them in the Discord the Discord uh is in the description um let us know what you guys are looking at I
2:38:43
saw this morning Niantic sold their business to um suple the company for 3.5
2:38:51
billion the company that owns Pokemon and Pokemon go Pokemon go yeah who's uh
2:38:56
scopely owns Monopoly go they own Monopoly go Monopoly go Monopoly is a
2:39:02
huge game game so basically two game companies merged well they sold off their business completely got out and
2:39:07
sold it to him how is that different for you than merging yeah because merging is
2:39:13
like these two companies are now going to work under one body versus here you go see you later uh sort of um so yeah
2:39:20
they bought them out yeah but what what signal are you guys getting from that to me that's just like okay we as nian
2:39:26
don't believe that we can deliver I don't I assume they're a public company don't believe that we can deliver more
2:39:31
value owning the company to shareholders than we could if we sold okay it was just crazy that I
2:39:37
didn't know Pokemon go was valued at 3.5 billion this not just gonna be that it's going to be the patents it's going to be
2:39:43
the game but Pokemon is still Pokemon go is still a thing man yeah it it'd be
2:39:48
making them dollar crazy yeah m&a is normal I'm With You Queen not sure how this made everybody's
2:39:55
radar uh okay chat we always want to know what we have not covered remember
2:40:00
this is going to become a cutdown episode that we want to absolutely smash on YouTube so if there is a big piece of
2:40:06
news that we haven't covered yet we want to make sure that we cover it this is our chance uh so if we've missed
2:40:11
anything uh please let us know this is the Great Joy being able to do this
2:40:18
together with you guys um so yeah let us know and we had a
2:40:25
couple super chats that came in over gaming is gonna pump there's no doubt about that gaming is gonna get better
2:40:32
and better my phony
2:40:37
account why didn't the and it's gone there it is why didn't the left turn
2:40:43
inefficiency into services and debt reduction so the right couldn't turn
2:40:48
inefficiency and Services into tax reduction uh I mean the very
2:40:53
straightforward answer is that when you're deficit spending you're never going to be able to uh
2:40:59
reduce the debt so they I don't even understand the question uh or maybe
2:41:06
you're asking it almost in a sarcastic manner that would make a lot more sense yeah it isn't possible so there in lies
2:41:12
the problem so and then also if tax uh if tax reduction doesn't generate more
2:41:19
tax revenue which shockingly actually does often happen uh then you're going to be in trouble and that's exactly
2:41:26
going to be the thing that gets Trump booted out of office so if we're not reducing the debt lowering costs uh
2:41:32
Trump will lose in the midterms and then the Republicans will lose in four years just is that simple if you don't fix the
2:41:39
economy you have problems uh go back Yeti Bandit had a question Yeti shout
2:41:45
out to Yeti OG Community member uh did yall cover Trump Prime marrying Thomas Massie we didn't I don't know a lot
2:41:51
about this so I don't know that we're going to be able to cover this in a meaningful way um but the whole idea of
2:41:57
primarying people man I what do I think about that it feels
2:42:03
icky that feels like Elites manipulating the system in a really gross way you
2:42:09
didn't do what I want get you voted out yeah that feels like a moral thing to me versus uh what if that's how the world
2:42:16
works you got to play the game the way that it's being played but I really don't like that but that's as much as I
2:42:22
know about it I don't know a lot so I can give you no deeper insights than that but if that's a big thing I will
2:42:27
happily look more into it uh what about mus giving Trump another 100 million uh specifics please and what way did he
2:42:34
give him 100 million sassy by sassy if you're talking about merging partnership versus
2:42:40
ownership usually when you merge with a company you've bought it out so you
2:42:45
don't have two competing leaderships so you can do a joint vent that would be very different than a
2:42:51
merger but a merger is an acquisition uh lth Tom can we get kaisen
2:42:57
characters and Combat gameplay and drop them into a survival monster catching game like Po
2:43:05
world no comment that's all I'm gonna say to that
2:43:10
right now slowly get yeah what do you mean uh
2:43:16
uhhuh that's all we're going to say right now uh um what else do we have here the skipper
2:43:23
of the tanker which hit with a North Sea ship full of fuel for US military allegedly is Russian has been arrested
2:43:30
okay I don't know about that but I don't know if it's popping off he's giving it to one of Trump's political
2:43:37
packs oh oh I mean geez that okay so the whole uh what's it called citizens
2:43:43
united thing that made it legal for people to make huge donations boys and girls that's not going to stop anytime
2:43:49
soon uh so you are going to see a ton of money coming in kit Moon a little too true
2:43:58
um yeah Yeti Bandit Thomas Massie is an OG on US debt won't vote for uh CR if it
2:44:06
increases spending also the CR includes us ID funding which makes zero sense so
2:44:12
the Govern a ID yeah the government was coming to another Cliff uh Thomas Massie didn't want to vote for the bill so he
2:44:18
voted no it held up the bill um and Trump is just saying either get on Trump team or we're going to primary you yeah
2:44:26
welcome to politics uh is that how I want to see things work no is that how it works currently yes so Landon
2:44:32
Hamilton what's up Landon it's good to see you Elon is the goat Landon it is so
2:44:38
funny how that has become extremely controversial I was at an AI conference uh yesterday and one of the guys on the
2:44:47
team of the people that I went there to meet with uh said what do you think about Elon Musk and I was like oh well this is I
2:44:54
don't know if you're saying that so you know if you should go key my car or uh what but that's interesting how that's
2:44:59
become a values test yes I am still extremely Pro Elon there's no doubt about that despite the fact that I hate
2:45:05
money in politics scroll back up wait uh oh wait infinite Warfare this is your last chance if this is weird I'm G to
2:45:11
move on uh what's your thoughts on animals mental health in domestication they lack Eugenics and are at high risk
2:45:18
of things like chronic p all right on that one he's not wrong like the uh animal industrial farming stuff is
2:45:25
pretty terrifying and I think that um David freeberg is probably right that
2:45:30
when we look back in 50 years we're all going to be pretty mortified at how they were treated so I don't think that's crazy uh I it's not one that I think a
2:45:36
lot about it is not my hobby horse uh but I do get it and I have a feeling that if I look too closely at it I'd be
2:45:42
mortified so yeah do you think gold back money could
2:45:48
be as popular as cryptocurrency since it is a commodity April I think people are
2:45:56
unable to stop themselves from Printing and I think that money printing ultimately is what people do and they do
2:46:02
it until they can't do it anymore and the currency hyper inflates there is nothing that leads me to believe that we
2:46:08
will stop ourselves from driving off that Cliff we might be able to delay it I think that we should delay it as much as we possibly can uh but all through
2:46:15
human history you accumulate debt debt until you were forced to have a debt Jubilee
2:46:21
which is another way of saying you kill a whole lot of people uh you tip the debt tables over so that the people that
2:46:29
um owned the debt basically go bust and the people that owed the debt are zeroed out
2:46:38
it's just it is what it is I don't see with the human mind a way out of that trap so I think it's going to play out
2:46:45
that same way over and over and over as it has done all throughout human history
2:46:52
do I wish that a gold back currency was popular yes because then you would stop
2:46:58
[ __ ] over the poor in the working class we don't live in that world Drew
2:47:04
we just don't anymore and inflation went down but it was 2.7 versus 2.8 that was forecasted well also so a non crisis Le
2:47:14
deflationary period is good so if we can innovate our way out of this amazing
2:47:19
but a lot of the deflation is because Trump is acting chaotically and it's ding the stock market down and so this
2:47:25
is not yet the positive deflation that people want this is the kind of deflation that if we don't pull out of
2:47:31
the Spiral you could end up with a mosive recession so nobody loves those
2:47:39
now are they necessary probably do we have to go through this probably because
2:47:44
you've printed so much money remember there is a between 6 and depending on
2:47:49
which uh study you look at I'm going to go with 09 uh there's a09 correlation between
2:47:57
the printing of money and the inflation in prices that basically means they are
2:48:02
the same phenomena so if printing money is inflation which people will bang
2:48:08
drums and say that it's not true to me that's just economically ignorant but
2:48:13
they will say the same thing about me um if that really is true then what happens
2:48:18
is is the cost of assets go up to keep Pace with inflation and that it's
2:48:24
actually relatively rare not not that it doesn't happen and this is why you saw the Magnificent 7 contribute so much to
2:48:30
the economy uh because they actually did grow in perceived value MH we'll put
2:48:38
that out there because there may be a correction right now of the actual value that they're delivering but the perceived value was that these guys are
2:48:43
[ __ ] amazing largely because of the ad dollars they were able to bring in anyway uh
2:48:49
um that you're just keeping Pace with inflation and once you realize oh the
2:48:55
emperor has no close this isn't real value this is just matching inflation and you do something that Spooks
2:49:01
sentiment now the cost of assets drops which is going to have a massive knock
2:49:07
on effect in prices all across the board because people start spending less money and the only way to get them to spend
2:49:13
more money is to start charging less but when it comes out of distress it can be
2:49:18
very very hard to get out of that spiral it's a consumer confidence spiral we are seeing that consumer confidence is going
2:49:24
down um so again a lot of this just is human sentiment versus the kind of
2:49:30
deflation you want where we innovate and things are just actually cheaper that's
2:49:37
where you want the deflation to come from uh Bill Burr is going viral for a clip where he caught out Elon Musk yeah
2:49:43
let's play it I watched this I didn't love it oh you did this my first time uh I just like see Eric the X clip not the
2:49:50
Instagram
2:50:03
one that idiot Elon Musk oh that guy like he's going to who evidently is a
2:50:10
Nazi like I just refused to believe that it was an accidental two times sey pause it for a second and he does it at a
2:50:16
presidential I know but listen this this so I love I think I got this
2:50:22
verbage from Destiny uh the idea of a calibrating question
2:50:28
so answer that do you think that Elon was dog whistling to Nazis when he did
2:50:36
his my heart goes out to thing if you say yes you instantly lose credibility in my
2:50:43
mind like instantaneously you can pull up images
2:50:50
of an ungodly number of people that when you freeze frame it they they they don't
2:50:57
look like they're doing a sigale they are holding their arm in that exact position kamla Harris is the one that I
2:51:03
can remember but there were a bunch of people that were calling him out and people were like oh yeah explain this explain this explain this all of them
2:51:09
doing it MH listen um is Elon a secret
2:51:16
Nazi I can't fathom I just like that holds no predictive validity for me when
2:51:23
I look at his behaviors and I go okay this is secretly a Nazi are these the things that he would do
2:51:30
no what like I I don't see what are the
2:51:35
downstream things that when you go he's a Nazi you're like yeah yeah yeah this now makes sense um colonizing Mars is he
2:51:42
trying to flee the Jews and so it's like bro I got to do Mars to get away from the Jews uh and so if he's like we we
2:51:48
can't have Jews be uh he has no Jewish Engineers uh which I guarantee is going
2:51:54
to be not true I'm sure he has plenty of Jewish Engineers um if he won't let them
2:51:59
launch satellites if he won't let them um go on any of the um if he won't be
2:52:06
part of the astronaut program and when they start actually sending people out there if he won't let them be in then i' be like oh [ __ ] like he really is just trying to flee the Jews how crazy I
2:52:12
never saw it coming um did he make Tesla because he hates Jews I don't see any
2:52:17
evidence of that um does Trump hate Jews bro is like 10 toes down for Israel okay that do know
2:52:25
he's back in the president that's like all for [ __ ] uh helping Israel I don't where's the [ __ ] predictive
2:52:31
validity like people just want to say I hate this guy therefore the thing that he did I'm going to read in the most
2:52:38
negative way possible because it matches the emotions that I have for this guy instead of going a [ __ ] hate this guy
2:52:43
he did a Nazi salute I want to drag him through the mud and so I'm going to say yeah this was a Nazi salute
2:52:49
pump the brakes every time I find myself wanting to dunk on the other side I'm like okay hold on slow down like you
2:52:57
know better than to trust that emotion what is the terrible reading here what has most predictability anyway I'll Loop
2:53:04
so I don't get it all right back to Bill bur there's
2:53:12
more inauguration this is why I hate liberals it's like liberals have no teeth whatsoever they just go oh my God
2:53:20
can you believe I'm getting out of the country I'm just like you're going to leave the country cuz of one guy with
2:53:26
dyed hair plugs and a laminated face who runs a who makes a bad car I
2:53:34
will say Bill bur's funny so this is one of those like even when somebody if
2:53:39
Destiny does a line of t-shirts that says Tom is a [ __ ] I'm still going to say Destiny's good at giving a very
2:53:48
thought ful analysis of a thing like I actually like seeing what he thinks
2:53:53
about my arguments to see if he can identify a whole so I'm not going to deny that bill bur is still [ __ ]
2:53:59
hilarious even though not a big fan of his take on Elon uh but you know
2:54:04
recognize him for what he's good at he he is very funny all right sorry keep going and has has an obsolete uh uh
2:54:11
social media platform you're you're going to leave this why doesn't he leave why isn't he stopped what do he so
2:54:18
afraid of this guy who can't fight his way out of a wet paper bag you can take him on like what is the
2:54:25
what wh why why do liberals just sit back and not they they they just they they have nothing what world is he
2:54:32
talking about Liberals are just sitting back they're actually firebombing Tesla dealerships uh I'm not
2:54:39
what do you want to see them do Bill exactly I'm not quite sure like what
2:54:44
would be a gangster enough response for him is that he wants to see people debate his points there are plenty of
2:54:50
people that do that and do that well um so I'm not sure what he's looking for
2:54:59
here all right doing why that says air March 10th 2024
2:55:06
is that just a typo and they meant 2025 because he's talking about him acting doing the Nazi salute and that
2:55:12
was in whatever November yeah that was in November that's Tapo okay sorry keep going
2:55:19
this okay this you got to speak up about it you don't just go like oh my God what
2:55:26
uh like like listen first of all it's like I'm a standup comedian it's not my freaking I'm talking about like
2:55:32
Democratic politicians where is their push back they're allegedly liberal you see this
2:55:38
guy do this thing what is happening right now so uh I would be very curious to know what push back he wants you've
2:55:44
got politicians all day every day uh joining in March not necessarily marches protests uh
2:55:51
talking about Elon as a problem we've got to get him out he's an unelected bureaucrat the very thing that he says
2:55:56
that he's fighting against he is we've got to get him out Deport him you've got him holding up signs like I'm not
2:56:02
sure what outcome bill you got to tell us more
2:56:09
please know what the end result of this thing is which all these neo-nazis not only they stupid because they're
2:56:15
neo-nazis they don't even look at what Hitler did he ruined their country and this idiot
2:56:21
is going to try to lead us down that road and then play it off and act like he didn't do what he just
2:56:26
did okay and you can get cancelled on I would very much like to know what
2:56:32
movements does Bill have in his head that Hitler did that he's saying Are paralleled by Elon
2:56:38
Musk uh because if the parallels are there then it's like oh cool let's talk about those let's talk about which ones
2:56:44
are problematic not problematic um that would make sense but there is this
2:56:50
really weird draw to saying that a person I don't like and maybe a person I
2:56:56
don't like that's in a position of power is hitlerian dude Hitler had a Playbook he
2:57:03
wrote it in a [ __ ] book and then actually went and did those things elon's Playbook like if you want to
2:57:09
Target Elon the thing to do is say money in politics this guy has become too powerful he is able to use his money to
2:57:18
move politics going back to my earlier thing don't do things as a one-off do things as a policy cool because Reed
2:57:24
Hoffman is also pouring money George sorus is also pouring money so there's a gaggle of billionaires that are pouring
2:57:32
money into politics let's get money out of politics word now this happens at a policy level so whether you're for my
2:57:37
guy against my guy whatever nobody gets to put their money into politics okay cool I'm here for that but if you're
2:57:43
going to say that a guy is like Hitler let's walk through what are the actual similari what are the things that you
2:57:49
see Elon doing that you think are actually hilan having read minec I will tell you I see exactly no parallels so
2:57:57
um I don't know what people are glomming on to with this
2:58:02
one I don't get it all right let's let him
2:58:08
finish there's a comedian for doing a freaking Caitlyn Jenner joke but this ass can can SE KY and nothing H where
2:58:15
are all the Liberals where are all these these these these white chicks at the award show they were speaking so I just
2:58:22
I'm going to find myself saying the same things to the things he's saying um yeah all right love Bill glad that he's able
2:58:28
to speak up think he's hilarious uh also think that he is misguided on his take
2:58:34
here but is what it is he's all burit hey lock I see you I see you thaw his
2:58:41
whole thing is being angry so long may Bill Burr be mad because he's very funny
2:58:47
uh so let the man cook let him do his thing but doesn't mean that you definitely have to agree with everything that he says actually I'm sorry you
2:58:53
don't like Pepsi I'm with you nor do I Elon thinks it's funny probably in a
2:58:58
more train wrecky way but sure it's his wife's fault maybe we are all shaped by our wives there's no doubt about that uh
2:59:07
Gazo don't know what you mean by take away the power take away elon's power uh Philly house let's see what we got here
2:59:16
uh Philly vanil says thank you Tom I went from anxiety to confidence about my job future software
2:59:23
product owner within 2 minutes with your help wow well Philly I am very excited to hear that that's amazing glad I could
2:59:30
help in some small way political feed says Elon is hilarious Tom we need a
2:59:35
nonviolent debt Jubilee wouldn't that be nice SW wouldn't that be nice and the only way to get it is to how would you
2:59:43
do it on the you owe money but you no longer owe money front the only real oh
2:59:49
God the fastest thing that comes to mind and I'm very conflicted about this but maybe on further analysis I will realize
2:59:55
that this is a good answer you create a sovereign wealth fund uh you go
3:00:00
generate trillions of dollars in value by um selling oil natural gas whatever
3:00:06
minerals we have all the assets that America has you get half of Tik Tok yada y y you invest in on behalf of the
3:00:12
American people and you pay them a dividend it could be something like that um or you get rid of the
3:00:20
um entitlements programs by creating a sovereign wealth fund that will take care of everybody's retirement and
3:00:27
instead of us having to individually contribute the government contributes into the marketplace and that grows over
3:00:33
time we could do something like that you could still back stop it with money printing oh God I hate that but uh you
3:00:39
could certainly do it something like that might work uh that's me speaking a little too off the cuff I'd really have
3:00:45
to look at that um that's about the only way that can think of that you could do a nonviolent debt
3:00:53
Jubilee um okay somebody's dropped in the Google Deep Mind robotics video uh
3:00:59
Eric I just liked that to you I didn't realize Google had a robot this was directly from their
3:01:05
Twitter page and it's based off of Gemini 2.0 they bring cap capabilities such as better reasoning interactivity
3:01:11
dexterity and generalization into the physical world a new generation of helpful robots
3:01:18
see what we
3:01:25
got family of Gemini models for robotics they're able to understand the physical world in a lot of detail understand
3:01:31
motion and be able to act in that physical world Gemini robotics is our most advanced Vision language action
3:01:37
model for robotics that means that it takes natural language input and images and then outputs actions they're really
3:01:43
dextrous they're doing some really intricate stuff like folding origami or like pack lunch there's this one task
3:01:49
where to put the bread slice in like a zip lock you can talk to them and physically move stuff around as the
3:01:55
robot is moving and you can see them reacting to you my favorite application is on the aonic humanoid we have this
3:02:01
task where the robot is asked to spellward with these Scrabble tiles it's this cross- embodiment dexterity
3:02:07
reasoning they all come together in this very cool task the other model really enhance the world understanding of
3:02:13
Gemini for robotics so it will do things like detect all the objects in 3D space
3:02:19
or maybe even identify parts of an object with semantic key points right now this stuff feels really awkward and
3:02:26
it is admittedly impressive but the right way I think to look at this stuff is to you have to project out five years
3:02:32
but five years of something very specific all of these things are going
3:02:37
to learn from all of the other robots so when these sort of really lame uh
3:02:43
versions of Gemini robot or uh Tesla Optimus whatever as they get deployed as
3:02:50
each one of them does a task and gets human feedback about whether that was good or bad instantaneously all of the
3:02:57
network Bots learn from that think of that imagine drew that I don't just
3:03:02
learn from the things that I research that I learn from the things that you research that Lisa researches that will
3:03:09
researches Eric everybody and now go out not 50 people go out 100,000 people and
3:03:16
in real time I'm getting updated with everything that they're learning every Improvement that they have is now spread
3:03:21
across the network dude like that's where you get into this superh human
3:03:28
rate of improvement that we're seeing in self-driving cars where the cars are just having to make so many decisions
3:03:34
and updating the entire network so that on that road a Tesla has driven a thousand times and they see oh the owner
3:03:40
had to take over here and they had to do this and so it's just learning and learning and learning and learning and learning and the more that you get them
3:03:46
out there the more feedback that they're giving within the network these things will improve at a rate that is freakish
3:03:53
and so if people stop thinking about oh that in a year that's going to be super lame and you start going what's it going
3:03:58
to be in 10 years it's going to be insane dude in 20 years I'm old in 20 years I'm not even going to be 70 yet
3:04:05
I'm going to be in my 60s in 20 years so it's like this stuff is going to be extremely relevant to my old ass in 20
3:04:12
years what's it going to be for somebody that right now is 10 they're only going to be 30 and so
3:04:18
they're going to live in a world where the the world is just proliferated by
3:04:23
robotics that's where all of this stuff like when you start looking at it through that lens you really start going
3:04:30
whoa this is going to be a world that my current thinking has low predictive
3:04:35
validity on and so staying involved understanding where this is going and asking yourself one question over and
3:04:40
over and over and over and over how do I today engage with that thing such that
3:04:47
I'm always a little bit ahead of everybody else and I know people do not like to think of this is a competition let's just say you want to get ahead of
3:04:53
everybody else so you can be the one that's most helpful great but understanding that you want to learn
3:04:58
this stuff you want to be at The Cutting Edge you want to be pushing your own thinking your own engagement all of that stuff you will deal with a period of
3:05:05
disruption far better than everybody else who's freaked out who put their head in the sand didn't pay attention to
3:05:11
this stuff hold standing still pretending as if it isn't happening is the the only
3:05:18
mistake got to keep progress going got to keep progress going and then our last topic of the day Eric if you could throw
3:05:24
up the parenting Instagram link that I slacked you my good sir I know we got a couple super chats we'll bang out this
3:05:30
last topic do some super chats talk to the chat and then get you on your intro game
3:05:42
word I can re like and before we let chat go you and I have to um figure out
3:05:48
do we have anything strong enough uh for this episode to really bang or do we
3:05:53
need to take 30 minutes and really [ __ ] go ham on something this was nuts is this what we're about to look at
3:05:59
yes oh my God to all the parents out there you are really going to want to pay attention to this this is bananas
3:06:05
can we zoom in a bit gracias all right little girl goes
3:06:11
on rampage inside of Walmart take it away absolute chaos broke out at a
3:06:18
Walmart today after a little girl was rampaging in the store grabbing anything she could see in sight and throwing it across the floor or stomping on it
3:06:25
eventually parents are stopping and wondering Hey where's this little girl's parents and she wanders all the way to the other side of the store these two
3:06:31
parents try to stop and restrain her so she can stop destroying things but then other parents come up and say hey it's not your job it's not your child maybe
3:06:38
don't stop her so they say he I guess so they let her go she keeps going on rampaging throughout the store the
3:06:45
craziest part to me this white girl keeps following yelling hey don't touch her don't yell at her don't touch her don't yell at her she could one day be
3:06:51
the president now you can see here the store employees are just watching it happen because they're powerless to do anything she could one day be the
3:06:58
president cool I love it let's say that she does end up being the president are people worried that she's going to be
3:07:05
like I remember that [ __ ] that restrained me at Walmart like [ __ ] that [ __ ] I'm coming after you and your whole
3:07:10
family what I don't understand that argument all right keep playing it because the fun continues
3:07:18
the store tells them not to do anything now eventually she walks over to these glass bottles starts throwing them
3:07:23
shattering glass and juice all over the floor this man runs up to try to stop her and the white girl shows up again so
3:07:29
say don't you touch her don't you touch her you don't know what she's been through as if that's an excuse to let her go on a rampage now I think the
3:07:36
situation is insane for two reasons one where are the girl's parents and two this girl that was following her around saying hey nobody touch her nobody yell
3:07:43
at her nobody try to stop her is absolutely insane as if the best thing to do to a child that's freaking out is
3:07:49
just let them break everything around them but that's my opinion let me know what you think in the comments make sure to follow if you on to dat with the
3:07:54
latest news wait that's the end of the video we don't find out whose parent this is this y
3:08:02
bro that is crazy town so speaking as a gen xer let me just tell you how this
3:08:07
would have played out if that had been me uh somebody would have grabbed me by the arm and I want to read Shay's saying
3:08:13
so don't go too far uh someone would have grabbed me by the arm and been like where's your mom and you're not touching
3:08:18
another thing this is madness uh they would have gone to my mom and said you're paying for the damage that this
3:08:24
kid did and so there was a whole thing back then you break it you buy it and my mom would have spanked my ass with a
3:08:31
wooden spoon and been like you're out of your [ __ ] mind and uh she would have
3:08:36
been right that's crazy and so you hold the parent accountable by making them pay for the things that are broken you
3:08:41
hold the child accountable if you're the parent and PS you restrain that child not violently but as I think this is
3:08:49
where Jordan has the right idea the minimum force necessary to restrain the child
3:08:54
um that is lunacy all right I want to see Shay who I know and love she says
3:09:01
okay parent speaking here uh there has been proof that media and Tech interaction has caused kids' brains to
3:09:08
start reacting as addicts but yes it takes a village inordinate inordinate
3:09:13
inordinate Behavior has to be stopped uh let's say crazy behavior but also attention to the child the
3:09:19
Rampage happened and no one is in sight that she quote unquote belongs to yeah so there's there's a lot of Madness
3:09:26
going on here but uh you can't let a child run right like that that kid does
3:09:32
not grow up to be well adjusted I will just tell you right now yeah it makes no sense to me it's like I feel like I just
3:09:37
watched like a horror movie and like the killer just ands kills everybody and just walks out the and then the credits
3:09:43
R I'm like wait what like you want to know how this yes like there's no what no way no way like I would have yoked
3:09:51
her I I don't care the the girl who was said with President well you and the president can get outside like that's
3:09:57
crazy that's you're throwing glass bottles around like that's like that's nuts that's nuts that that is unhinged
3:10:04
uh yeah I'm not sure Miggy they didn't necessarily learn it from somewhere a kid will test the rules what they
3:10:11
learned is that they can get away with absolute murder and nobody's going to
3:10:16
check them and they can just keep going and keep going and keep going Professor nii with mouse Utopia okay I've actually
3:10:24
done some research shout out to uh please God what if alst uh who I know
3:10:31
has had his own troubles but um he's the one that brought up Mouse experiment that basically when things go too well
3:10:38
and populations are allowed to grow unchecked without any sort of restraining impulse they actually
3:10:44
implode and start like attacking each other it is absolutely fascinating that there is some sort of um trip wire that
3:10:54
makes the human psyche implode when it doesn't have difficulty to deal with and
3:11:01
the Matrix got this right in the movie if you haven't seen it I can't believe how old it is now that there's a lot of
3:11:07
people that haven't seen it um in the movie the creators of the Matrix who have quote unquote slave enslaved
3:11:13
Humanity they say we built you a Utopia and you ejected it like we lost entire
3:11:20
crops of humans because they could not deal with a Utopia they couldn't deal with things being okay they need
3:11:26
problems they need a thing to harden them to push back I will also say trees that you uh that grow up inside of a
3:11:32
dome will fall over because there's no wind they're never tested and so they don't have to go strong grow stronger so
3:11:38
they end up folding under their own weight which is absolutely fascinating the human immune system if it is not
3:11:44
assailed by germs it will grow weak and so you actually need difficulty like I
3:11:50
am so grateful shout out to my mom my mom is the only thing that kept
3:11:57
me from running Riot I have so much respect for my mom because I would test
3:12:03
the limits and every time I tested the limits with my mom I found a limit she was like nope not doing that and
3:12:10
whatever it takes uh we're going to draw a line and my favorite story of my mom was I had a friend who came into school
3:12:17
one day we were 13 he comes into school one day and he said my mom tried to slap me and I blocked her and she just broke
3:12:23
down in tears and my mom's never going to touch me again I now am in control and I was like bro the next time my mom
3:12:30
tries to slap me I'm going to block her this is going to be so gangster I can't believe I never thought to do it so one
3:12:35
point I I remember where I was standing at the front door about to leave for school and I'm pushing my mom and
3:12:42
pushing and she telling me to do something I'm like no not gonna do it no no no she goes to slap me boom block it
3:12:47
and I'm like gotcha and she goes to slap me on the other side and I was like whoa and I blocked that side she caught me
3:12:53
with the third one and I remember standing there and being like my mom's built different I was like respect and
3:13:00
and I was like oh got it cool okay my my mom's not here for play like the when
3:13:06
she came with the third one I was like I didn't expect it I was like I defeated both sides what do you mean now I won
3:13:13
I'm the new champion and my mom was just like no no no we're not going to play like this is the line and the thing is
3:13:19
in my mom's offense I was legitimately being a little ass and I was just seeing like how far I can push it and uh there
3:13:26
was a line and there was not going to be any Crossing it I was like it's like I
3:13:32
still feel it like for me having a daughter I didn't want it to be okay that like I'm allowed to hit her so I
3:13:37
have a weird like line of like beating my like beating her why wouldn't beat that's a pretty terrible word I would
3:13:43
never say my mom beat me spank I would I would yeah I wouldn't spank LAN but I have like a good like flick thing that I
3:13:49
do that kind of just annoys her at the right amount and just like dog whispery [ __ ] yeah yeah just a little like thing
3:13:56
my mom used to do like a ear thing where like I'll be at the church and she would like do this I'm like ah and that's all
3:14:01
like it didn't hurt but it was just like a public shaming kind of thing cuz I'm like did other people see that like it
3:14:06
was different so I think that there is levels but for a child to do that in Walmart she has to have done that at
3:14:13
home she had like and gotten away with it yes kids don't kids don't just wake up on like okay I'm going to terrorize everything it's like no I'm a test one
3:14:19
limit okay I get away with this I'm going test this Limit Oh I can do whatever I want at the house well maybe I can do whatever I want at Walmart so
3:14:24
there's a escalation that you should have this should have been addressed years ago let alone to say look at this
3:14:29
video and say she's just tripping or something bad happened or there's something that led up to this this
3:14:35
doesn't just come out of nowhere yeah I think kids are programmed to push the limits see where the boundaries are it
3:14:41
it from an evolutionary standpoint it's good you want kids to push and like get out there and try to take control of
3:14:47
Their Own Destiny and all that cuz ultimately they going to have to completely reject their parents and survive on their own um so it's good
3:14:54
that they test the limits to find out where the limits are but if there are no limits you now have a problem and this
3:15:00
used to be something that because people were um they were in a a literal life and
3:15:07
death situation that you had to keep people in check because they would die
3:15:13
or they would create a vulnerability in the tribe and you couldn't have that uh once that evolutionary pressure goes
3:15:19
away people start running some pretty crazy experiments mhm but I'm glad they do so I can see what happens crazy so
3:15:26
Chad wants to know like exactly what you guys would do if you were the parents there Tom would you do what would you do
3:15:31
what you said the 80s and then Drew would you like do the little tick thing what would you actually do if you were
3:15:36
the parents in that situation I think Jordan Peterson has summed it up perfectly the minimum amount of force so
3:15:42
I would use the minimum amount of force possible to get my kid to chill uh and I
3:15:47
would immediately eject out of the store I mean I would out of a sense of moral duty I would pay for the things that she
3:15:54
broke uh I would pay for the things that she broke eject her out of the store and probably on my way out I just have to be
3:15:59
like here please take down my phone number because I am going to come back and I'm going to pay for this but right now my child is melting the [ __ ] down
3:16:07
I've got to get them out um but deal with that get them out and then um would
3:16:13
I go full 80 style we're not in that world like I wouldn't carry a wooden spoon like my mom did um just because
3:16:19
we're not in that world and that's going to be read in a totally different way and I play the game that I'm actually in versus the game that I want it to be uh
3:16:27
minimum force restrain and then figure out to everybody's Point that's been saying like um you don't get here
3:16:34
overnight I'm now going to be like okay what's going on I'm letting them get away with murder whatever I'm doing is not working um and figure out what's
3:16:42
going on um yeah then yeah me personally in that specific situ not my child I
3:16:48
would do I seen one of the other dudes kind of try to Corn her out like I would at least child pick up the security the
3:16:56
front office the front like return area you just kind of restrain her in that corner get your mom she tries to go this
3:17:02
way I block her sit back down go this way block her she Stomps up jumps up and down you can have every tantrum in this
3:17:07
circle but at least now the rest of the store is not perod to your terrorism now
3:17:12
it's contained and now from that section call the parent call somebody somebody kind of come get this child if that person has a beef with me we can talk
3:17:19
about it I'll have the managers back me up if you want to sue me we can talk about it I'll take I'll go court for court on that order um that actually
3:17:24
reminds me of another thing that happened I don't know if you've seen this one no a dude was a lifeguard so that that's my answer to that but a dude
3:17:31
was a lifeguard I have to pull up the story and there was probably like six or seven kids in the pool he jumps in to
3:17:36
save the kid who was drowning like saves rescues the kid but then the parents Sue because it took him too long to save the
3:17:42
kid exactly and because of like the policy and everything because of the the trial the Lifeguard ends up losing his
3:17:49
job and then now they're actually at trial to figure out like whether or not he's actually responsible or not this is why they're Good Samaritan laws it's
3:17:56
like you do not want to punish people for trying their best to help you do not want to incentivize people to be like
3:18:01
yeah I'm not getting involved um now if the guy lost his job because he wasn't
3:18:08
doing his job and so he's spacing out he's playing on his phone and let's say that like hey you can't do that this is
3:18:14
like you're here to protect people's lives um that I get But ultimately to me parents have the ultimate responsibility
3:18:21
and so um you want to create a situation where where the business is like really
3:18:27
on their [ __ ] to make sure that whatever um level of protection they're saying we offer that they really offer it uh but
3:18:34
you do not want to start suing people because you don't like the way that they helped like that's that is a bad place
3:18:39
to be in it doesn't make sense all right chat we're going to land the plane uh we got a couple super chats that came in
3:18:45
let's shout them out and then we'll get you on somebody said a lot of speculation with very few facts I don't
3:18:51
know what that was related to but I'd love to address it if we have any info on that all right but super chats yeah I'll check that out
3:19:02
um uh we got that one already we're I think jedward would be the next one all
3:19:08
right Euro Euro CLE EC European
3:19:14
custodian of Russian USS was overlooked by fish Europe can direct EC to strip Russia of
3:19:19
her assets this move will give Putin a significant legal claim against
3:19:26
EC oh that's why um Fishman was saying that the European Union should push to
3:19:32
have the Russian asset seized and then given to Ukraine as as aid but I guess the comment is saying Euro clear would
3:19:39
prevent that if Putin sues EC in a friendly jurisdiction Hong Kong under G EC's asset domicide there may be a part
3:19:46
of the judgment issue it is unclear whose assets would be affected by such an incumbrance yeah so this is where you
3:19:53
realize that all of these alliances are on paper and the only thing that matters is what you can enforce either through
3:20:00
other economic sanctions um or getting other nations to ban against that person
3:20:06
I mean ultimately it's going to become sanctions either they're booting you out of uh a trade Alliance or something like
3:20:12
that but it's only what you can enforce man yeah and so I made a comment like
3:20:17
this and I saw comments about I don't think people really understood what I'm saying uh when I said the Constitution
3:20:23
is is only worth the paper that is printed on and they were like what the [ __ ] how can you say that what I mean is
3:20:29
that Stalin had one of the most pro-democracy constitutions ever and yet
3:20:35
he was still killing his own people on mass so I'm not saying that a Constitution doesn't matter in that it
3:20:43
sets your country up but what matters a lot more than that is whether people agree that it should be enforced if
3:20:49
people don't agree that it should be enforced or they're not willing to stand up for it and say you're not enforcing this what the [ __ ] uh then it doesn't
3:20:55
matter so it doesn't matter if Euro CLE can like make this a problem the the
3:21:02
thing to ask is if something like Hong Kong says yo like violation but all of
3:21:07
Europe is like don't give a [ __ ] where are you so is Hong Kong really going to do something about it is China going to
3:21:13
do something about it if so then now it's we're down to the stick and yes if you smash people with a big enough stick they will get in line
3:21:21
um but I think what Edward Fishman is getting at is that stick doesn't exist
3:21:27
and so they could play that card as an act of warfare saying I want this
3:21:32
because to understand Edward Fishman you have to understand he believes in economic Warfare just as in war you kill
3:21:40
the enemy he's saying whether it should be or not is irrelevant this is how the game of economic Warfare is played
3:21:47
the strong will do as they will and the weak will suffer as they must and so um it's risky from a piss off your ally
3:21:53
standpoint I think the US did themselves Dirty by freezing Russia's assets us did themselves Dirty by freezing Russia's
3:22:00
assets because it led people like China to go yeah we're getting out of US debt don't don't want to hold this anymore
3:22:06
and they started selling off whether it was directly tied to that it certainly didn't help uh and so China started
3:22:12
selling off their us assets if the US said hey we don't [ __ ] with people's finances then the World Market would get
3:22:18
a very different cue and they'd be like hey being in treasuries is us treasuries is a safe place because they they just
3:22:25
don't play um so yeah it's going to have consequences but you're only as good as
3:22:31
what you can back up yeah and then jedward said this last thing Banks using EC to custody their assets are suddenly
3:22:37
exposed even if they have no direct ties to are you to Russia EU cascad the confidence euro dollar offshore USD
3:22:43
crisis where banks no longer trust other Banks exactly those are the second and third or Consequences that you run into
3:22:49
that if you're not thinking uh wisely about you can get yourself into a lot of trouble there's no doubt about that um
3:22:55
now Super Chat from Felix question have you seen the new AI agent Manis from China is a crazy step forward for
3:23:01
automation yeah we covered that on Friday um absolutely have seen it it is bananas it is a portent of things to
3:23:08
come on two fronts one the AI agents will be able to do a lot of cool things for you and the whole theory of the Dead
3:23:14
internet is going to become freakishly because the amount of content that will be created by AI for AI is going to
3:23:23
become extreme now why would you create something for AI because all of us are going to have our Manus that are out there going hey scan the X feed for this
3:23:30
but the X feed is being written by another Manu and so it really does start to become a human asking AI to create
3:23:38
content that will rank well with other AI content so that when it comes back to the human that it's uh it is the thing
3:23:44
that is captured and that it's summarized in the way that you would want it to be so that's the dead
3:23:49
internet things created by AI for AI ultimately in service of humans but yeah
3:23:55
humans using AI as a way to get the attention that they want to make the money that they want etc etc perfect seg
3:24:01
way to Michael MC G's question will AI replace YouTubers if you could just train AI on your channel and spam out
3:24:07
content same for non YouTubers endless output of content no real people yeah it will happen uh that the spam content
3:24:13
will exist that there will be far more content being generated by AI than there will be for humans the right question to
3:24:20
ask is will humans Embrace virtual influencers or over time will they spend
3:24:27
more time with humans and the answer to that is which will add more value to their lives will they feel a deeper
3:24:33
emotional connection to somebody who's a real human who's lived a real life or will they just be like no this guy gives
3:24:38
me way better takes uh on this stuff than the real human and so uh even
3:24:43
though I know they're an AI influencer um I like them or will it be like oh I like AI influencers created by this
3:24:51
person and so um I don't know I don't know but I will tell you that people get very attached to uh characters in
3:24:58
stories they get very attached to characters in games so clearly they don't need them to be real humans they need them to make them feel something uh
3:25:05
and if AI is better at making you feel the things you want to feel then AI will win all right and then this one is
3:25:12
another one from Michael MCG thank you for the Super Chat Tom why aren't people like you running for president why are there all morons with inflation Fiat
3:25:18
over taxing working middle class and so on okay that's very generous and now let's remember uh all of my fallibility
3:25:26
okay so in that context so why do people why don't I run for political office it
3:25:31
is nightmarish nothing about that appeals to me so even talking about politics has um brought drama into my
3:25:40
life that was not previously there so you already have the like who just wants
3:25:46
that level of drama there is a certain kind of person they are drawn to it um also because I know that you can make
3:25:56
money in the government but it's in a way that I don't like and I want to
3:26:02
create self-sustaining economic engines uh I find myself far more drawn to um
3:26:08
the private sector but if you look at David saxs who's maybe the example I
3:26:14
find the most interesting because he divested himself of everything um to
3:26:19
become the crypto and AI Zar so he will create hopefully a world that the rest
3:26:26
of us can get economic gain from uh while he is not able to participate in
3:26:31
that that initial big pump and so that's a pretty incredible thing to do is there
3:26:38
a time where I will do that for me the answer is such a hard fast aggressive no
3:26:44
that when I just think about my personality I want to tell stories man and that's the world that I want to live
3:26:50
in and so I just can't see myself doing it I'm just not drawn to it all the realities of politics I'm not drawn to
3:26:58
and I I think you have to have something in your personality as a politician to say
3:27:04
look at me listen to me and the Nuance difference of why I'm in front of the
3:27:09
camera is I want to be one point of reference that you take in in a much
3:27:16
larger constellation of people that are helping you navigate the world well I'm way more comfortable with that than I am
3:27:23
with saying hey go do it this way that's why all right Ed kisy thank you for the
3:27:30
Super Chat everybody we left behind by AI robots I think we'll go to Universal income purpose in life is for humans to
3:27:35
fulfill their potential there's a lot of different things in there so I agree that the
3:27:42
purpose or for humans to be fulfilled they have to have meaning and purpose uh the psychological state that humans
3:27:49
should be pursuing is fulfillment it's the only neurochemical state that is both positive and enduring meaning that
3:27:57
you can feel fulfilled even if you're grieving the loss of a parent
3:28:02
um happiness is far too transient meaning and purpose is an
3:28:08
absolute core element to the pursuit of fulfillment cool so we know people are going to do
3:28:14
that the ways that we have historically gotten that will change dramatically
3:28:20
with AI and Robotics because the lwh hanging fruit of um moving the economy
3:28:26
forward solving problems a lot of that stuff is going to be taken care of by AI
3:28:32
in robotics and they'll be better at it than we are this is why even though I don't have
3:28:37
children a piece of information that I would love for people to really contemplate is is it more important than
3:28:45
ever to have a child and I would say to have children I would say for
3:28:50
fulfillment purposes it is the most straightforward most likely to be
3:28:57
successful path it's the most likely path to
3:29:03
survive the thusi Trap of humans versus Ai and if instead of trying to win um in
3:29:13
the global domination of it all like we do now to out compete each other if we
3:29:20
turn inward and say um instead of universal basic income we have Universal basic services that Drew has brought to
3:29:26
the table so many times um and so most of that stuff is taken
3:29:31
care of so I want to focus on raising my children well you have an evolutionary algorithm in your brain that will will
3:29:37
reward you richly for doing so um and if you don't actually have to struggle to
3:29:43
have a house to have food that kind of stuff then uh raising children well becomes a very Noble Pursuit so that
3:29:51
that is a um a future that I can look at and go yeah I can get how humans
3:29:57
maintain meaning and purpose and dignity uh by pursuing that path now there will be second and third order consequences
3:30:03
of AI and Robotics that I cannot anticipate that maybe that won't matter and you won't need to do that and you
3:30:09
can keep playing the kind of game that we're playing now but for that to be true it would have to create jobs that I
3:30:15
cannot yet enter anticipate now it it may very well do exactly that as advancements and Technology have always
3:30:21
done historically and I know anytime you go to say this time is different you should check yourself but this time
3:30:27
really does feel different so um that's how I when I look into the future that
3:30:32
is what my brain hands back cool uh we had another one from
3:30:37
Stephie Lynn bbom I don't see a message but thank you Stephanie Lyn for the Super Chat uh Zach goldwaser as well um
3:30:44
message not set edit and try it again thank you Zach we'll edit and try that again um Michael MCG loved interview
3:30:51
with Ed Fishman guys we've been telling you this a good interview with Ed Fishman please go check it out he really breaks down tariff sanction what's going
3:30:57
on Russia China all these things that's happening uh would you like to see Gary Stevenson AKA Gary economics on like to
3:31:02
see you push him on his theory and solutions love him but still unsure about his Solutions we reached out to
3:31:07
him right we have reached out to him he's in the UK his schedule's a little bit busy he's in the middle of a book tour he just released a book so he told me when things slow down he'll let me
3:31:13
know so ouch cold Scher spam his channel if you want one there it is um we just
3:31:20
we just called that one out uh Eric I think that's all of them yeah that that Ed one we just
3:31:26
that's the one we just talked about uh can you paint a picture of us thank you Felix for the $5 Super Chat um
3:31:33
can you paint a picture of us in 2050 we all have free robots Building Homes roads infrastructure everybody lives in
3:31:39
their own village with friends uh yeah I by 2050 uh the the
3:31:45
more accurate reality is some portion of humanity I don't know if it's 99% or if
3:31:50
it's 9% but some portion of humanity will have barring uh catastrophic War
3:31:56
something that stops technological process or barring um artificial intelligence hitting some sort of upper
3:32:02
cap and not becoming artificial super intelligence if we don't have war and intelligence continues at the pace of
3:32:09
growth that it's at now um some I think very substantive percentage of the world
3:32:14
will integrate technology including AI into their biology uh so you will see
3:32:21
this is by 2050 you will see humans become a midwife for a new um form of
3:32:28
creature will we become entirely synthetic uh I don't know but you will see Society bifurcate that that is for
3:32:35
sure now the question becomes will there be pockets of violence like I'm optimistic for meaning it's only pockets
3:32:42
of violence I don't think there's any way to move into that future without
3:32:47
Puritans as I will call them feeling that we are defying God's Will and when
3:32:53
people believe that you're defying God's will they tend to kill so I think there will be pockets of violence um My Hope
3:33:01
Is that it's small otherwise you will see allout conflict between the
3:33:06
augmented and the UN augmented this is exactly what the comic book neon future that I wrote um was about so that just
3:33:16
feels like the inevitable 2050 future uh people will live large swads of their
3:33:21
life inside of uh simulated realities it will be the ultimate um exploration some
3:33:27
people apparently will live on the moon some will live on Mars man do I find that a thrilling future um but yeah
3:33:34
that's what I think it's going to be and then there will be some people that just completely reject technology uh they revert to something like a ' 9s level
3:33:41
technology uh they live as you said in villages communities um and it's all all
3:33:46
the time and I think it's great people should have that choice and awesome I think that's it you
3:33:53
want to give a sign off and then we can jump uh Robert says Tom and neon future who won so unfortunately halfway through
3:34:00
writing it I realized there's no money in comic books uh and so I did not finish that story but it's called neon
3:34:06
future neon as in positive for a reason so uh you can certainly understand my bias as an Act of Faith I believe that
3:34:14
uh Innovation and Tech technology make the world a better place and will continue to make the world a better place uh but that is a very aggressive
3:34:20
bias that I have and I fully expect um that the religious among us will have a
3:34:27
very different take on that um I will just remind everybody that you
3:34:32
live in a universe that is not locally real not locally real boys and girls
3:34:38
crazy Z says wait no go back I want to say that out loud I was gonna say that
3:34:43
Zach says scroll up uh Zack goldwaser says I have a 9.4 graded copy of neon
3:34:50
Future Let's go I really think drew that is going to seem pretty prophetic here in a few years I really do what does 9.4
3:34:58
gry copy mean uh meaning that it's in very very good condition nice and so he's got it in a sealed uh packet God
3:35:05
bless him God bless him okay everybody unless this is your last chance you know all the things that we just covered is
3:35:12
there anything that we missed that's popping off in culture remember that's
3:35:17
the key it's popping off in culture is there anything popping off in culture
3:35:23
right now that if we don't cover in this episode that it will the episode will perform
3:35:30
poorly that is what my beloved beloved chat if you can help pull the blind
3:35:36
things out of our eye isan says uh Bitcoin just like a check in on bitcoin where's it at let's see where is Bitcoin
3:35:43
right now Bitcoin price is at
3:35:50
82.7 uh okay so I mean to me there's no red flags here so Bitcoin is a highly
3:35:57
volatile asset it is going to go up and down um so yeah I just think that it is
3:36:03
what it is now admittedly I bought the vast vast vast vast vast majority in fact every that I bought in Bitcoin I
3:36:10
bought far below 82.7k so I'm like hey I'm still up not up by as much but no worries uh so don't
3:36:18
worry about short-term fluctuations that would be my advice as have a thesis
3:36:24
however you invest have a thesis as long as that thesis remains true stick with it uh it is only when you put yourself
3:36:31
in a position where you would need to liquidate in let's say anything less
3:36:38
than 5 years you probably have yourself in a um dicey position but if you always
3:36:44
have enough Capital saved up that you can at least a year you're probably going to be fine then you can pick your
3:36:49
moments if you need to get the money out otherwise I remind everybody please invest only the amount that you can
3:36:55
afford to lose or that you can afford to have down at any one moment uh because I get ultimately you probably want enough
3:37:01
there that you can retire on but that should be like a 30 40y year Horizon if you do that it's going to be less scary
3:37:06
so I always keep enough money on hand to run the company forget my life to run the company if the company was making no
3:37:14
Revenue whatsoever that I could continue running the company um so you want to have large stock piles of cash for your
3:37:21
life for your life for your life so if you can go a year you're in pretty good shape that's how I think about
3:37:26
it all right what else anybody see anything will you should be deep deep deep in there have we missed anything
3:37:33
either from now or from
3:37:39
earlier our David Kim our divid Kim oh damn I hey that's a win we got David Kim
3:37:46
listening again cuz for a minute was that Canada bro right the
3:37:51
[ __ ] intro was that Canada yeah can's like you done oh man uh let me go talk
3:37:58
to Brandon was shing how um so I think they could still hear us
3:38:07
standby that can't be true how are we still alive that's impossible
3:38:12
impossible oh yeah we are still are we really up chat we're in the dark can you guys
3:38:18
that's funny do they still have image that's hilarious no it's a black screen well yeah but meaning it's broadcasting
3:38:25
the darkness here open the curtain see if they can see anything that's hilarious well chat I have no idea what
3:38:32
happened but we just lost electricity but only on set or is it that the
3:38:38
generator down only Eric can be heard that's so
3:38:44
weird yeah your mic's not working it's like
3:38:51
somewhere yeah uh please give them our love tell them
3:38:57
that God has made it very apparent that we need to write the intro all right guys we're going to be uh writing our
3:39:03
intro and getting started with the episode uh looks like we got power back on okay we we might be back on
3:39:27
is off just turn back on we will be all right we'll see we'll
3:39:34
see there we go well we're back I'm so curious how many people dipped out
3:39:39
will 792 so about like 50 yeah it was like it was like 58 so not a lot of
3:39:45
people that's crazy well thank you guys um the good news is you know how we talk now when uh we don't think we're live
3:39:52
and I think that it's exactly the same I love these live chats we get to
3:39:59
see how the sausage is made and what happens when you lose electricity when you're making sausage yeah who would have thought did not see that one coming
3:40:05
was not on my bingo card for today uh but there we are all right so sorry what was David saying if you try to hit if
3:40:11
you try to hit the switcher does it change camera uh it does not stream let me turn so bear with this
3:40:18
chat it's going to be a bit of a limp across the finish line here but I'm eager to hear what David had to say what did he
3:40:29
say yeah you continue go ahead well new AI release from Google open source model
3:40:35
you can run on phone full on work stations and supposedly outperform open
3:40:42
AI new 03 Mini okay um do we have anything that we can
3:40:48
look at or this is just hey it exists and a it's a mobile AI from Google it's
3:40:54
basically my understanding of it is that they have created something that is so
3:41:00
efficient it can run on your phone uh and if that's true obviously for us trying to build intelligent toys
3:41:09
um that is very beneficial uh the only question is how expensive is the chip but um
3:41:15
if it can run on a phone it's probably very lightweight so that's certainly encouraging yes pretty
3:41:22
I don't know I don't understand this question but you might understand this he says Tom is okay with second amendment rights gun is very powerful
3:41:29
enough to kill multiple people but Tom is okay is okay with everyone having a
3:41:34
nuclear weapon in their back pocket every powerful Innovation is a double-edged sword there's no nuclear
3:41:39
power without nuclear warheads and if AI is going to be one of the most powerful Technologies human has create it how do
3:41:46
we distribute it well first let's address th is not okay with everybody having a nuclear
3:41:51
weapon in their back pocket that strikes me as a Surefire way to die very very fast uh so AI the way to keep AI in
3:41:59
check is to make sure that it's open source so um right now people like emod
3:42:05
mostak are working as hard as they can to make sure that AI um is available to
3:42:11
everybody everywhere all at once I think that is very wise uh Elon Musk very similar where he says we'll see if he
3:42:18
actually does it but that as each model becomes mature he will open source the model before it so that strikes me as a
3:42:25
an easy way to generate Revenue but also um make it available to other people so
3:42:31
I'm all for it so yeah that you since there is no way to stop uh AI from
3:42:38
existing you want to proliferate it to as many people as you can um and the Bad
3:42:44
actors that are going to use it AI to try to do bad things other people will use AI to try to do good things and just
3:42:50
like with weapons we keep each other in check by saying okay you can [ __ ] me up but I can [ __ ] you up right back uh you
3:42:55
will have and and that actually does create uh a reasonably stable piece you
3:43:01
will find the same thing with AI word all right I just liked you the thing it's deep seek so deep seeks Mini
3:43:08
model uh what's have to do with Google it wasn't a Google thing I think it
3:43:13
might have just been a nomencl clature thing got but yeah it's deep seek R1 distill Queen
3:43:19
kwen um it outperforms 4 and Cloud 3.5
3:43:24
on math and mobile benchmarks and it's on the phone completely got it love that and so okay yeah go ahead and play
3:43:40
it well uh is there no audio on this so he asked it a question but we'd have to
3:43:45
zoom way the hell in is there really no audio on this yes just sound okay so let
3:43:51
me read this thing then uh here it is running on a phone completely offline sorry outperforms GPT 40 and Claude 3.5
3:43:58
which is interesting because 3.7 is already out on math benchmarks here it is running on a phone completely offline
3:44:05
tiny 1.5 billion AI model that will run on almost any hardware even without
3:44:11
internet are you getting it yet okay love that so um here's why I like that
3:44:18
this is going to free up a level of innovation like I am hungry for this right now literally right now I am
3:44:23
working with manufacturers to help us build um a toy that can sync up with an
3:44:28
in-game character so that players can have a relationship with an in-game character that's driven by AI which by the way David Kim the guy in the feed is
3:44:35
the guy that has deployed that character for us um so the early stages it's still trash it will get better anyway uh so
3:44:43
you've got an AI character in game an AI toy out of game in real life and the two
3:44:48
what what we're trying to do is sync them up it may not be possible yet I guarantee it will be possible in the near future but the big thing is how
3:44:55
much is this thing going to cost because you want to make this as cheap for people as possible to make the experience awesome to get it in as many
3:45:00
hands as possible so you need an a very effective AI to have a very small
3:45:07
footprint so that you can put it inside of these toys for very cheap so that you need a very small chip uh that doesn't
3:45:13
have to be super powerful to run this very powerful brain and what we're seeing is that one of the ways that you can really innovate in the world of AI
3:45:20
is to make the level of um compression
3:45:25
better and better and so the reason this is a big deal is they're showing that these things can remain incredibly
3:45:32
powerful with a really highly compressed data set and that is awesome that will
3:45:39
unleash a ton of human creativity not the least of which will be here at impact Theory so uh I'm very excited
3:45:44
about this copy okay and then I just sled Eric the the Gemma 3 which is that was the Google one and that is their
3:45:51
most capable model yet it can run on a single GPU or TPU yeah so same idea here these are
3:45:59
getting more and more efficient he click that graph on the right that kind now what I hope the guy is meaning when he
3:46:04
says are you getting it yet is that this is becoming very cheap very potent very
3:46:12
fast and the rate of change is the thing that people are not they're just not
3:46:18
grappling with yet so from the time that I launched my manufacturing search till
3:46:24
now this is already upgraded so fast that I have to now broaden my scope of
3:46:30
who might be able to supply this to us which is absolutely incredible but this is why I say companies are going to get
3:46:35
smaller they're going to be more dextrous because whoever pulls the trigger on something because at some point you have to pick a chip buy it at
3:46:43
a certain amount of scale and you're going to want to keep that scale tight inherently making your um options small
3:46:50
like the number of people that would be able to get it small because you're not going to be waiting a year to launch the next one you're going to be launching
3:46:55
the next one like in a month two months and so it creates this this is why people freak out about deflation by the
3:47:01
way because it creates this impulse well I'm just going to wait I'm just going to wait I'm just going to wait and so
3:47:06
um you want to you now have to think about doing small order quantities make
3:47:13
them very cheap so that you get around that impulse to wait and you create that sense of well I'll just buy that one and then I'll upgrade every six months or
3:47:19
whatever because they're cheap and so um I just want them to get better and better and better and I want to be able to take advantage of that and so that is
3:47:26
going to have consequences that we can't yet anticipate but proliferation is one
3:47:32
of the most obvious where now if I can have something as good as um GPT 4 put
3:47:40
into my fridge so that my fridge can run a constant scan of what's in my fridge what I need to reorder use a gentic AI
3:47:45
running in my fridge to go actually place the orders on Amazon or send me a text and be like hey I'm about to place
3:47:51
this order cuz you're out confirm or deny dude it's going to be awesome bias
3:47:57
bias bias I have a freakish bias towards Innovation but that is thrilling to me
3:48:04
this is going to be fun this is going to be fun the thing that really jumps me for this is we were talking about deep
3:48:09
seek being a big deal and that was a month and a half ago you would have thought deep seek came out out six weeks
3:48:15
six months ago like it was something that happened like it's we were they just disrupted the market and I'm using
3:48:21
air quotes January 27th we or something we released our video and then now March 12th we have a model that's just as
3:48:28
powerful if not more powerful in a fraction of that size now so immediately the form factors are changing and since
3:48:34
it's a Sprint there's seven different companies all innovating in different levels on different ways and those are just the ones you know about yeah there
3:48:40
there's some 14-year-old right now coming up with some crazy compression algorithm that's going to make AI even smaller even faster we just don't even
3:48:46
know they exist yet that's why the right mental model for what's happening right now is that this is 1999 internet bubble
3:48:53
and nobody knows whether uh are any of the players that are going to be major players in 10 years are they even out
3:49:00
yet so we all think it's AI or we or uh open AI this could all be net suite and
3:49:06
Netscape and all those like we haven't got to the chromes the app store yet all that that's a great analogy correct so
3:49:13
uh we are all gonna benefit as the people that get to build with this use these things uh it's going to be
3:49:19
incredible but Act of Faith is required admittedly cool um all right we really got to go all right for real for real
3:49:25
for real for real they they really tried by cutting the power and we just wouldn't wouldn't listen all right chat you guys are amazing I cannot thank you
3:49:31
enough for being here for pushing us um for bringing things to our attention that we would have otherwise missed you
3:49:37
guys are amazing uh we are going to be um cutting the episode Down into roughly call hour hour and 10 minutes somewhere
3:49:42
around there uh running it as an experiment we'll probably do a few of these and if it works better then we'll keep doing it uh and if it's worse then
3:49:49
we will revert back to the original version and uh we'll report back all right if you guys haven't already please
3:49:55
be sure to subscribe and until next time my friends be legendary take care peace
