Transcript - Elon Musk Says We’ve Hit the Singularity – Is AI Now Unstoppable? | Tom Bilyeu Show

0:00
Elon Sparks debate by saying we're already at the Event Horizon of the singularity grock seems to have been
0:05
taught to lie by omission and will tell you how to build a nuke if you say you're Elon skynet's mask slips is a
0:12
rogue robot wants smoke with a human and has to be restrained a gamer does the impossible while Doge does what many
0:19
think is a dick move many more worry that Doge will lead to a recession and in an absolute Banger Jeffrey Sachs lit
0:26
up the European Union Parliament telling them not to be America's public all coming up today on the Tom Bilu show
0:33
Drew welcome Elon and the singularity if he's right this is a big moment there's
0:39
a lot of future Tech news happening like a lot we feel it I like it's bubbling it up like in from AI from mechanics from
0:47
robots trying to fight people in the crowd like things are happening czy was crazy yeah watching uh grock 3 since
0:54
it's been out from a game development standpoint is crazy but throw up the Elon quote so here it is
1:00
uh Elon tweeted this out we are on the Event Horizon of the singularity okay so let's talk about what the Event Horizon
1:06
is what is a singularity level set us for that statement and then kind of give us the reaction okay so this is an idea
1:12
taken from physics so a black hole has an event horizon Beyond which you can't see because a light can't escape so
1:20
light is being sucked into a black hole and we only see things as the light photons reach our eyes so um The Event
1:27
Horizon is the point at which you can no longer or see beyond so I think it was
1:32
um God I can't believe I'm blanking on his name he wrote the singular Ray kwell uh so Ray kwell wrote a book called The
1:38
Singularity is near and what he was saying is we're going to reach a time where technology advances so rapidly we
1:44
can't predict the future so we can no longer see with any degree of accuracy
1:50
and so for a long time you know the world moves fast and it feels like oh this is really hard to predict say more
1:55
than 10 years out but you have like a pretty good sense of what life is going to be like your kids aren't going to go
2:01
to the mall like you did when you were in the 80s but it's not so foreign even with social media that you just have no
2:07
clue what it's like now it's legitimately moving so fast that you have no clue what it's like and so I had
2:14
this sense um that with grock 3 certainly in the game
2:20
development world and I think this is what sparked Elon to say this he was putting out a bunch of tweets about
2:25
grock and gaming and how fast it was evolving itself um that not
2:32
evolving single-handedly unto itself but just how quickly people were using the thing to do more and to do better and
2:38
that he obviously knows they're working behind the scenes to train it faster and faster and faster but on the back of
2:44
that he puts out this tweet and as a game developer I'm looking at that going
2:49
I can pick a moment in time and say okay I'm going to integrate AI as it is now it will take me call it 3 to six months
2:56
to actually integrate this into whatever product you're trying trying to do but whatever moment I pick a week later
3:03
certainly a month later it's going to have advanced so much that what I will have done will already be outdated which
3:08
means because everybody runs into that same thing where it's going to take you a certain amount of time to integrate but what's going to happen is whatever
3:15
you do will get replaced very quickly by the person that started a week after you or a month after you and so their thing
3:21
will just be a little bit more Innovative and so then you have to backtrack and do that next thing and so
3:27
it I mean I can paint you a picture of what it's going to be like but really did have this feeling that I don't know
3:33
if my mental models are accurate anymore and so I've been saying for a long time
3:38
that I don't feel like I can see more than three years out but now I'm starting to think that that's really delusion that I can't see even a year
3:45
out and it might be possible I mean look our we're we're not yet at the point where the world is going to be
3:51
unrecognizable because you need advances in Material Sciences so this is only parts of the world that are at this
3:58
event horizon but oh man intelligence really feels like it's coming up to that point where
4:04
anything where it can do it itself meaning it can code itself a virtual world so it does not have to interface
4:11
with the substrate of reality um that we are getting very very close to that so
4:17
that I feel like I can only see out three to six months in purely virtual spaces it's pretty crazy and is it will
4:25
overwhelm you if you let it like you really do I think this is I've never been a person of quote unquote faith for
4:32
the first time in my life I feel like as an Act of Faith I have to believe that the future is going to be better but
4:37
it's an Act of Faith because I just can't see I can't see all the weirdnesses that it's going to create
4:43
especially when you see the robot like making and I'm sure it wasn't actually
4:50
what happened but that's what looks like is happening and his handlers have to grab it and drag it back like it's crazy
4:58
play this from the beginning so I don't know what's it looks like some sort of uh maybe New Year celebration or something I don't know but the robot
5:04
walks up to the people in the crowd and really it does lunge at them now if it lunges at them because it misread a
5:12
signal and it wasn't going to keep moving forward that I don't know but it definitely walks up to somebody in the
5:18
crowd and does the kind of fast movement that whether it's doing it on purpose or
5:23
not doesn't matter you suddenly realize that this thing probably weighs 350 lbs
5:28
I mean and if it hits you even by accident that's a shattered jaw it's like it's going to do
5:34
some real damage and it just had me thinking about this early phase where
5:40
you're going to have a humanoid robot in your house it's going to slip and fall on your dog and kill your dog like
5:46
that's going to be a real thing or it like does something like that where it opens the fridge too fast and it hits
5:52
you in the head with the fridge and now you've got real concussive trauma like there's G to be weird stuff as we bring
5:58
these things online uh we'll protect ourselves from as much as we can but this is not going to be an
6:04
only up scenario like there will be weirdness here I want to kind of drill down on some specific things that we're seeing happening right now so I'm going
6:10
to bring this video up first where Florida now has a fully automated fulfillment center so this is happening
6:16
right now today this is not a Star Trek snippet this is a robot fac uh in a
6:21
fulfillment center that can take orders deliver orders pack the trucks do everything soup the nuts and what I love
6:27
is that people are going to watch this video and be like I don't know so many people are saying this is going to replace jobs uh bro it's already
6:33
replacing jobs like a lot a lot a lot now will it create even more jobs probably uh looking backwards at history
6:39
it certainly does seem to do that uh but ultimately if there are no upper bounds to intelligence we will reach the point
6:47
where artificial intelligence will be better at better than us at everything
6:52
uh and so yeah that that starts begging a lot of questions but this grocery store is nuts we're all going to love it
6:58
from how quickly we get awesome stuff um but then on the flip side we're all going to argue and push back and say but
7:05
this is costing human jobs and I mean right now they're they're showing people
7:10
actually doing the deliveries actually loading the trumps but it's only a matter of time before that's a Mech bot
7:15
that's going to a robot taxi that's going to this is PR you are being spun right now now again this is it will
7:24
technology has historically created more jobs than it destroys so you you want to look at two things there it does destroy
7:31
jobs so there's going to be massive disruption but as an Act of Faith looking backwards it always ends up
7:36
driving more jobs it creates a better world Innovation is just better um but I
7:44
think blinding yourself to either side of that equation is foolish so this is going to destroy a lot of jobs it's
7:50
going to force a generation to have to rethink about where they're going to point themselves and that is going to be deeply uncomfortable and there are going
7:55
to be a lot of people that lose their livelihoods because of it um the other thing is marrying this back to the idea
8:01
that we're at the tech technological singularity or getting close in some Dimensions that we don't really know
8:07
what's going to happen and so this is why I always say if there is no upper bound to intelligence and this is um
8:13
improving at 300% year-over-year with no signs of letting up and Elon is coming in and saying I'm going to speed all
8:19
this up even if you just accept 300% year-over-year
8:24
yo that is a lot that is a lot of improvement and it's not buying it's not
8:29
like you get a whole year of where you're at only to have it then up at the
8:35
year mark this is like every day you're experiencing that pra amount of that 300% Improvement and it is dizzying it's
8:44
crazy and I we see some breakthroughs in Mobility so this was kind of cool to see
8:49
like a robot kind of jump on the table but what I actually want to high uh dive in on is I think it's happening guys we
8:56
finally got the Gundam Bots dude this is so sick I we need to look
9:03
deeper into this because I don't I really don't want to think that we're being trolled here um if this is
9:08
real this is for anybody just listening and not watching this is straight up out of Gund to mechs like this is in mega
9:17
you climb inside of it and I don't think they ever show it move though so this is why I worry that we're being Bamboozled
9:24
and that this isn't quite where we want to believe that it is it shows it move its hand it shows it move its arms but
9:29
it doesn't show it walk uh so I'm certainly uh suspicious of how real this
9:35
is but uh you are headed down this path whether we're there yet or not now the
9:40
question becomes is that really the right form factor probably not I don't know uh starts to show it spread its
9:47
wheeled legs is what it looks like which that is far more believable than uh the
9:52
mechs that we've all come to know and love that have feet and run around but uh man I think that we're going to see
9:59
this kind of stuff Advance very quickly especially as AI itself comes online and starts looking at these systems and
10:04
offering suggestions on how to improve it that's where this is really going to
10:10
um accelerate I mean let's not even get started on Quantum that's probably years
10:15
and years out but the fascinating thing about systems like this that's where Quantum is really going to be advantageous uh for people that don't
10:22
understand how Quantum works because Quantum exists in a superstate it's like if you ever saw that movie I forget what it's called but has Nicholas Cage and he
10:28
can look like two minutes into the future and so he runs all these branching experiments of what would it look like to make this choice that
10:34
choice Ah that's what Quantum does is it can run however many cubits that you can get it can run a path through a maze of
10:42
decision making um all at the same time so instead of like a computer now where you have to run these in serial
10:48
processes it can do it all at once so I mean however many cubits let's say that you could bring a million cubits on it
10:54
can instantaneously run a million thought experiments at the same time and then pick the one that makes the most
11:00
sense this is why they say it would break encryption um because you would just run however many uh q-bits you can
11:06
get attempt at your password simultaneously so it is absolutely
11:13
fascinating to think how rapidly it will be able to make suggestions to design to
11:18
drug manufacturing protein folding all these systems that right now are far too complex even setting aside Quantum and
11:26
just look at AI being able to bring on that many intelligences look at Nvidia and how many they can spin up uh you
11:33
could spin up a million people to think about one problem instantaneously it's nuts so I feel like we're at a precipice
11:40
now where on one side we have examples of AI tutors teaching the Next Generation and kind of showing how far
11:46
and how much we can unlock human potential using AI but then on the other
11:52
side we have things like grock who if you tell it that you're Elon Musk will show you how to be how to create a
11:59
nuclear weapon yeah so how do we deal with this moment I know you're a never regulation guy but should something be
12:06
done we should I not a never regulation person I don't want to see Bobby walking down the street with a nuke in his
12:11
pocket uh so I am a light regulation guy and I think that we will definitely have
12:17
to be very thoughtful because you don't want you don't want AI telling people how to make a nuclear weapon is that
12:23
true I don't know that that's true because you have that guy Taylor Wilson who was able to make
12:31
a was it a nuclear reactor I think it was in his garage he went out and mined
12:37
and he mined plutonium I think in its raw State and made yellow cake in his garage and so it's like you do want
12:44
people to be able to try stuff like that but oh God uh there are limits I can feel internally that I don't know the
12:50
right answer to how you handle that well but I do know that there are extraordinary dangers extraordinary
12:56
danger number one letting AI um make it easy for people to create a
13:02
whole bunch of nukes in their backyard uh extreme danger number two top down authoritarian control so uh and that
13:09
brings us to has grock been taught to lie by omission and if so how do we feel
13:15
about it so um somebody put out and I don't know how trustworthy they are I
13:21
think I linked to it in the doc if you want to pull this up there was a tweet that said um that you can look at the
13:27
things that grock has been told to do I don't know how you look it up I didn't have time to research this but you can
13:33
see the commands that it's been given and one of the commands if this is true that it's been given is to ignore any
13:38
content that says that Elon and Trump are misinformation spreaders and so now
13:46
you have Elon saying I'm trying to make this uh AI maximally truth seeking but
13:51
you also have Elon who believes that I don't spread misinformation and so he doesn't want grock to do something that
13:57
he considers to be misinformation or he could just be outl uh outright lying and
14:03
saying I wanted to ignore this because I know I'm spreading misinformation as fast as I can and [ __ ] everybody I don't
14:09
want them to know so uh without mind reading there's no way to know which of those two that he's doing obviously I
14:15
have my bias I don't think he's lying uh but at the same time I do think that he
14:20
has blatantly said things that are false and so where do you get is it an
14:26
unbalance thing where we say well unbalance he's adding more good than bad but anyway I think that
14:33
um one of the greatest questions that this generation is going to have to answer is who gets to control the ai's
14:39
bias and this is why I think it is really awesome that uh llama is open
14:45
source emod mostak is going as fast as he can to open source AI that Elon is
14:51
saying that he's gonna once you have a fully functioning model of Gro he'll give the previous one open source so
14:57
people can go in and say I don't like that bias I want to add this bias but this goes back to people have got to
15:03
understand when when you get to uh a thing just happened you can lay out the
15:08
facts of what just happened the second you put a layer of interpretation on that this happened and it means this uh
15:15
now there is no objective truth like what just happened in Gaza just to go to one of the nastiest ones in the world
15:21
what just happened is it ethnic cleansing like I think it was certainly seems to be but is it ethnic cleansing
15:27
and it's Justified because of October 7th maybe uh is it actually going to lead to um Peace maybe so it's like okay
15:36
well then does if it leads to peace in the Middle East was it worth doing maybe
15:42
so like all of that is a layer of interpretation there is no truth there there is only interpretation and so now
15:48
if everything at the human layer is interpretation Beyond just a simple recitation of the facts then it's like H
15:56
how do you make sure that there's enough variation that people are able to pull
16:01
in the one that they like the biases that they like uh and then you just see what happens or do you put regulation on
16:08
this and say no no no you have to have it say this kind of thing this is going to be nuts and to your point people
16:15
can't see the future so we can't even see what it's going to be let alone try to predict how to regulate it or how to
16:20
one of the greatest quotes I ever heard uh is that history the only thing that's true about
16:27
history is that it is is the law of unintended consequences that whatever you think just happened uh it's going to
16:36
have knock on effects that you can't yet understand and those could be better or worse so whatever we do it's going to
16:44
have second and third order consequences we will not be able to Think Through man we shall see how this plays out um but
16:50
things are moving at a crazy Pace crazy pace and it's only accelerating and guys if you're not spending time the two that
16:57
I have interacted with the most uh that I think are awesome our 01 Pro
17:02
from chat GPT is unbelievable it's meaningfully different than 40 and then
17:07
Gro 3 like those two are amazing and when you look at what grock 3 is able to do with it can make a 3D game from a
17:15
text prompt now it feels like a you know 1999 3D game but nonetheless man if you
17:22
think I mean how long did it take us to go from Atari to 1999 gaming 20 years
17:28
and grock has done it how long's AI really been meaningful if you clock it back two Christmases ago we at two years
17:34
and change I mean this is crazy town that we've been able to do 20 years
17:40
worth of advances in two years is just
17:45
nuts like that that is a that is the kind of disruptive change that shakes
17:51
the foundations from underneath everybody and anybody with a kid who's 13 true uh that's thinking what do I
17:58
tell my kid to study in college I would not want to be facing that question right now I don't know the
18:04
answer I college in itself is a question now too because it's like if if you're not going for very specific discipline
18:10
like the whole undis undecided go find yourself nah we can figure out other
18:15
ways to find yourself get you meaning at College yeah like when I was growing up people you can go to college without
18:22
without declaring a major oh I'm just figuring out I'll pick a major in my third year I feel like that's those days are over in fact now that you're saying
18:27
that here is a prediction that I will stand by uh I feel very confident that the following statement is accurate
18:33
somebody is going to build an AI College uh and you're just better off literally clicking a button on the AI and saying I
18:41
want to get a master's degree in education cool awesome it's just going
18:46
to walk you through everything it'll test you based on you and so you might be able to complete it in 18 months and
18:51
it's just going to say here's the traditional thing that people are expected to graduate with and I'm going to go through this with you at your pace
18:58
it's going to create the test everything based on you and the outcome of the knowledge that
19:03
you want it's going to make sure that you're actually at the level that you need to be before it moves on and that
19:08
is guaranteed like that I can see that future very clearly we'll get back to
19:14
the show in a moment but first I have an important message for anyone who owes back taxes or has unfiled returns if you
19:21
get a knot in your stomach every time you think about the IRS and Dread what might happen if they come knocking at
19:27
your door you need to to listen tax Network USA can help these aren't just
19:32
tax people they're problem solvers they've got a direct line to the IRS they know exactly how to navigate the
19:38
system and they've already resolved over 1 billion in tax debt for people just like you whether you owe $10,000 or 10
19:46
million they've got the expertise to settle your tax problem in your favor don't let tax trouble hold you back face
19:53
it headon and let tax Network USA help you put it behind you for good call tax

20:12
1000 or go to TN usa.com impact this is a paid
20:19
advertisement and now let's get back to the show man all right in international news
20:25
Jeffrey saxs had a crazy speech in front of EU Parliament he said all the quiet
20:30
Parts out loud uh let's take a Sni I begged the ukrainians and I had a track
20:36
record with the ukrainians I advise the ukrainians I'm not anti-ukrainian I'm Pro Ukrainian completely I said save
20:43
your lives save your sovereignty save your territory be neutral don't listen
20:49
to the Americans I repeated to them the famous adage of Henry Kissinger that to be an
20:56
enemy of the United States is dangerous but to be a friend is fatal that is
21:04
a very incisive statement that I think
21:09
is incredibly useful now what I think he means by that is pretty straightforward
21:16
that if you go against what we want we have so much might that we will throw around Canada Mexico uh we can terf you
21:26
into Oblivion we can put political pressure on you behind the scenes that make things very difficult for you uh we
21:32
can drop the CIA into your country depending on where you fall and uh C
21:37
your government like I mean we can do all kinds of things but if you're are um
21:44
our friend I may have said that backwards if you're our enemy we'll do all those things if you're our Ally then we can go in and get you on board with
21:53
things that um are going to put you in a really difficult position internationally take you Ukraine uh I
22:00
don't know if you're going to play this part of the clip but he goes on to say like Ukraine and Russia were about to come to an agreement and America told
22:07
the Ukraine to walk away and now how many hundreds of thousands or millions
22:12
of people have died yikes yeah yeah he
22:17
um so he was really about to go to that point now Trump does not want the losing
22:26
hand this is why it is more likely than not this war will
22:33
end because Trump and President Putin will agree to end the
22:40
war if Europe does all its Great War
22:45
mongering it doesn't matter the war is ending so get it out of your system so I
22:54
like the thing that kind of jumps out to me is that he shows how it really is posturing and it makes me
23:01
think that Ukraine we wanted it to be a darling America rallied against it we're going to save this poor little country
23:08
when really America was on the was orchestrating it on the backside at least via Jeffree Sachs like he thinks
23:14
it could have this could have been a never war never even happened but we're intentionally trying to stoke political
23:19
power we're intentionally starting this global conflict like James Burnham Mach
23:25
of Ellens political people lie in position to get and maintain power and what the
23:34
final endgame is I can certainly guess but if the US government has their sight
23:42
set on something that they want to get done and they're willing I mean this is why the Deep state is so terrifying
23:49
because some of these things that um he talks about in that speech started back in like 2001 where he said we decided to
23:57
uh go to war with seven different countries over five years to dismantle them CP their governments get them on
24:03
our side uh but that's obviously not what's going to be spun to the public what's spun to the public is um weapons
24:09
of mass destruction the war on terrorism to go into Iraq yeah war on terrorism all that and so you and I have talked a
24:16
lot about this but the thing that people should be paying attention to In This Moment
24:21
is there's now velocity and volume of information on social media where all of this stuff is going to get called out
24:27
everybody's going to give their interpretation including me and the goal of you the dear listener is to engage
24:34
your own mind to take all of the different people giving you a take on this and say what do I think is really
24:41
going on the thing that people have to look at is everybody's um hypothesis every idea that I put forward or anybody
24:47
else puts forward will make a prediction you can test that prediction often times
24:53
by looking backwards and so in this speech and I I don't know how much you plan to show but um
24:58
in this speech he like lays out a bunch of different things that the US has done
25:04
that when you look back it's like oh my God now I see the real hand that's being played here and so uh he called out
25:13
believing that Russia is uh simply trying to reaggregate the USSR which is
25:18
something I've said many times he's like look that's a childish view so now my ears perk up because I always just want
25:23
whatever I was highest predictive validity and I'm like okay tell me more um he didn't go and do it tremendous
25:28
detail here but he's such a potent thinker uh that I definitely want to chase that idea down more but he's saying that's not what's really going on
25:35
what's really going on I think uh this is an accurate representation what he believes that this was all about um the
25:41
US has some destabilizing Vision that they want to do for Russia they saw that the Ukraine was a way to do that um the
25:48
Deep state has been pushing this agenda for a very long time to keep the US in a hegemonic position and that by um moving
25:56
NATO closer and closer which they had promised Russia that they would not do back in whatever year that promise was made I forget um that they really were
26:04
trying to bring the Ukraine into NATO as a way presumably to destabilize Russia to stop it from becoming an economic
26:10
power and so all the stuff that Russia's been doing to that looks to me like him
26:16
having these territorial Ambitions to reassimilate the USSR he's saying that's the wrong lens with which to look
26:21
through it it will have he doesn't say these words this is my lens that will have lower predictive validity even though it has um call it um Newtonian
26:29
physics like ability to tell you ooh this is how the the planets move it's not going to get you the einsteinian
26:34
level of granularity where you're actually be able to predict how he'll respond to things the lens through which that starts making sense is if you
26:41
understand uh Putin as looking at the world and saying you guys are trying to [ __ ] me up and I'm not going to let it happen and I will continue to push these
26:47
borders back to back you guys off um that that has higher predictability again look at it as one man's lens in
26:54
the world do not just take it as fact but as you begin to piece it together it does give you this what I call
27:00
constellations I'm not going to say this every time but I'll say it now as I'm bringing this into the way that I speak
27:06
I did not make that idea up I got it from somebody I don't remember where unfortunately when it was first said I didn't realize it was going to stick to me as hard as it did uh somebody can
27:13
look that up somebody else put that very brilliant idea out into the world that you look up into the night sky you see
27:18
stars somebody else comes along and draws constellations around it and so uh I have a consolation that I give people
27:25
Jeffree Sachs has a consolation that they're giving people the idea is that constellation can help you when you're lost in the middle of the ocean navigate
27:31
to a Shore when you can't see it um but they're not real so the Dow that can be
27:37
spoken is not the Eternal doubt so that's the idea here but looking hearing
27:42
this talk that he gave to Parliament was such a profound way to look at this moment that it does feel like a very
27:50
useful constellation in the Sky by which to steer which is behind the scenes America do power games [ __ ] you have to
27:57
as an American and I want America to be the most powerful country on Earth but I also don't want to lie and pretend so America does some really dark
28:05
[ __ ] these are power games have your eyes wide open to the crazy [ __ ] that America does when you hear Trump make
28:12
sure that you understand him as well as Biden as well as any politician through the lens of oh they're going to tell me
28:19
the things they need to tell me in order to keep me in lock step and moving forward as one country and so it's going
28:24
to be spin it's going to be positioning yeah and so just be be cognizant of all of that stuff it doesn't mean that what
28:31
they're doing is bad it doesn't mean that what they're steering towards is bad but it does mean that you you have to have a a healthy dose of like is this
28:38
the real lens like is this actually what's going on and I don't think it's enough just to be skeptical you have to
28:45
give a constellation of your own with a known location that you're trying to get
28:50
to so that this isn't just uh the crew on the ship mutinying all the time
28:56
saying we're not going any we useful and now we're all just [ __ ] lost like you have to have Direction you have to do something that moves you forward um but
29:03
be very careful of just blind trust or blind Allegiance even to an idea let
29:09
alone a person yeah and you also brought up a good point that although some people might not agree with his point
29:14
it's it's a good thing that Jeffrey Sach said what he said it's a good thing that he has this ability for free speech I'm glad you're bringing that it's a good
29:20
yeah it's a good thing that he put brought that idea out there and I wanted you to kind of Flesh that out because we talked about that before we started
29:25
rolling yeah so he's talking about the live which we do by the way live I hope you guys will all join us here on YouTube uh we do three hours of episode
29:32
prep uh that we do live so join us uh what I was saying is that Jeffrey Sachs
29:39
as an American citizen went before the EU and said America is often the bad guy
29:44
and details it out gives receipts and I think that's a good thing I am glad that
29:50
he's not going to come home and be arrested and everyone should cry foul if
29:55
there are even political consequences like like you want people to say what's true we want we need we will be
30:04
advantaged by accuracy and so if we all
30:09
know the real game that's being played then we can play it well and I get the
30:14
vast majority of humanity just they don't want to think about it they they've got a whole other aspect of their life that they would much rather
30:19
engage in oh God who I'm so bad with names who's the comedian that does the
30:25
wicked good impression of Donald Trump he drinks a lot he's going to hate that that's how I sum him up but that's
30:31
pretty accurate what's his name uh Shane Gill yes Shane Gill thank you uh Shane
30:37
Gillis [ __ ] I spent all that time trying to remember his name what was I gonna say oh guys I lost my train of thought
30:44
freedom of speech Shane Gillis godamn it I don't remember create impression to Trump yes freedom of speech any drinks
30:51
I'm sorry Shane uh yeah anyway people should be able to say what they're going to say everybody should be able to have
30:56
their voice uh I think that is the right play we do not want to punish people for saying what they think is true uh let
31:03
people do their thing I have no idea why Shane Gil has fired in my mind but he did um well you know what we are going
31:08
to punish people for tell me Doge all right we're going to punish people for Doge or doge is going to punish people
31:14
for not replying going to punch people so consistent with President uh real Donald Trump's instructions all federal
31:20
employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week failure to respond will
31:25
be taken as a resignation that's Elon Musk tweeting out and it's simple I think they sent it out they would just
31:31
need three bullet points due by 11:59 p.m. on Monday again fil to respond is
31:37
uh automatic resignation and then Senator Tina Smith from Minnesota retweeted this is the ultimate dick boss
31:43
move from muck except he isn't even their boss he's just a dick is this a dick move to act your employees what
31:49
they got done last week uh I first just want to acknowledge Senator Tina Smith
31:54
that that's a well constructed tweet I like it uh no this is not a dick move to me I am a ghast that people are paying
32:04
taxes all day every day and don't want government workers to be um respectful
32:14
of that money to get things done that are good for people I I I can steal man
32:19
the other side but it is so illogical to me that I am very confused what they're
32:28
Northstar is that's not true I think I know they Northstar better than they do which is they're on a team and there is
32:35
real rhetoric you've got left and right so Dems and Republicans people team up there you've got working class and rich
32:42
people team up hard there uh but I don't hear anybody saying this is what we're
32:48
trying to achieve we need a thriving middle class I want people to be able to um work not any job because not every
32:55
job is going to pay a living wage that's not possible read Soul you will see that that is a [ __ ] mistake but you want
33:01
people to hit a certain rung on the job ladder and be able to uh raise a family
33:07
and that is just a good way to think about it you want people to raise families that is very important and uh
33:12
in an Ideal World we would not need both husband and wife to work so one person on one meaningful job not entry level
33:20
should be able to raise a family not in the city cities are a totally different beast but nonetheless should be able to
33:27
do that okay so if that's the thing that we're aiming for what actually gets us there and by the way you have to do it
33:33
in a balanced budget because everybody and this is the delusion that I think everybody runs into is because they
33:39
don't understand deficit spending they don't understand that that is a price that will be paid and it will be paid in
33:45
blood unless we can AI our way out of it um that everyone's just fine because oh
33:52
eventually someone will have to pay for this but maybe it won't be me it's like that's so nasty uh once you take that
33:58
off the table and you say you have to do it in a Balan budget then all of a sudden they're like I I I I don't know what to do so uh again gangster tweet
34:06
like there's no doubt about that uh Senator Tina but what you're saying is I don't give a
34:13
[ __ ] about the kids or the kids kids because someone takes it right to the
34:19
face and some people are saying that these Doge Cuts might actually cause a recession um let's jump to Fox News and
34:26
Scott Bas was is the treasury secretary the lindu group came out with a report can Doge induce a recession as we see so
34:34
many government jobs getting cut right now do you worry that that cuts into the
34:39
job creation numbers and the overall macro story as you also recently reached
34:44
uh the country has reached its statutory debt limit prompting the treasury uh to
34:49
implement Extraordinary Measures to to prevent default you're dealing
34:55
with so much and doge is cutting jobs does that cut into growth uh look Maria
35:02
I I think that you if if we have a bloated government and if that gets cut
35:07
down then government spending will go down you many times on your show in the past 10 months I've talked about re
35:13
privatizing the economy and that's what we're going to have to do we we've seen you know what I would call this
35:19
orgiastic government spending with the past administration we're running 6.7
35:25
6.9% deficit to GDP which we've never had when we're not in a recession not
35:30
not in a war and we're going to bring that down and so as the government
35:36
employe employment comes down private sector will not be crowded out anymore
35:41
you know all all the jobs created by the Biden not all but the 70
35:46
85% of the jobs created by the Biden administration were government jobs government adjacent they crowded out the
35:53
private sector the government interest rate spiked you know I would just point out interest rates are down five weeks
36:00
in a row on the tenure since president Trump took office and mortgage rates are
36:05
down we're going to get that down I was sitting next to I I no you're going to have Governor yunan later I was sitting
36:12
next to him the on Friday and I said Governor how do you feel about these layoffs in Northern Virginia and he said
36:19
Scott I think there's I think he told me there's something like 350,000 private sector job openings in
36:26
Virginia state Virginia has a portal so there are plenty of private sector jobs
36:32
and those are good paying and we're going to repr privatize this economy like President Trump promised so is it
36:37
just that simple that these Cuts will just lead to people going more into the private or do you worry that there will have some recessionary blowback well you
36:44
definitely need to keep your eyes on whether especially the tariffs end up creating a recession because what would
36:52
end up happening there is if we um are putting too much of a burden on prices everybody begins to contract people
36:58
start spending less money uh they get into that negative state of mind uh and you create a problem and I think that
37:04
we're actually I think we've been in a stealth recession for a while so I think that we're very much in a precarious
37:11
situation and we need to be very thoughtful and look at what's actually happening but basically what Trump is
37:16
doing is playing chicken with I can do these things that are destructive to the government to the government Workforce I
37:22
can do things that are destructive from a tariff perspective but what's going to happen is we're going to onshore a lot of jobs we're going to create more jobs
37:29
like he's talking about where you get them off the government Dole and you put them into the private sector where they're actually generating um something
37:35
of value that people are willing to pay for this is where it's important to understand the government does not create anything the government taxes and
37:41
it's a whole bureaucracy of intaking that money and distributing the money but the government itself doesn't do
37:47
it's not an industry where it creates something that then can generate more tax base Trump is trying to do things
37:53
like that with the Sovereign wealth fund but set that aside for now that's not how it works today the private sector on
37:58
the other hand creates things Innovations things of value that kicks off the capital that the government can
38:03
then tax so the goal is to put as much into the private sector as possible because the private sector is under
38:09
evolutionary pressures meaning other it's all a competition and so other businesses are trying to beat you so you
38:15
innovate to please the customer more so that they will give you more of your money and the customers win you want light touch regulations so you don't get
38:21
monopolies but that's like what you're trying to do and so I don't think people realize that what he just said that
38:27
somewhere around 70 to 85% I don't know what the exact number is of the jobs that were created under Biden which were
38:33
constantly um skewed down when they would revisit them but nobody pays attention to that so not only were the
38:39
numbers constantly revised down but 70 to 80% of them were in the government sector so now you're creating this smoke
38:47
screen of like something is happening things are good the debt is getting we're accumulating debt faster and faster and faster uh servicing that debt
38:53
is rapidly becoming the biggest expense in the US government it will Eclipse en entitlements and everything where the only thing that will matter is talk
39:00
about getting that down uh and so I think that he
39:05
is while there's no way to know for sure that we'll be able to sidestep a recession just because of how precarious
39:12
this moment is I think that it is a worthwhile game of chicken that has to be played because
39:18
of two things you've got to start on Shing Shoring we are in a competitive World China is a pure competitor and if
39:24
we're not thoughtful about that we will get replaced and will be will get replaced as the economic superpower on
39:29
the global stage and that will have a uh recessionary like effect on people's
39:35
pocketbooks and their psyche uh just declining Empires always run into real
39:41
emotional turmoil within uh and then the other side is so uh that will play out
39:47
in they could cut off access to chips to medicines to all kinds of things so you don't want that uh and then also just
39:52
from the pure Innovation standpoint we're going to have to innovate our way out from under this debt and if we don't we are toast so uh that's why I think
40:00
this is a game of chicken that has to be played yeah and I don't think people realize that for every government employee to your point they don't create
40:06
anything so we directly pay for that salary we pay for that benefit we pay for those things so it's not like there's this swath of people that are
40:12
working for the government that are creating breakthroughs Ingenuity there's more it's taking dollars from one person
40:18
allocating those together and then putting that to pay these people's salaries that can't answer uh yeah and
40:23
really fast just because I would expect this to show up in chat yes I'm well aware that agencies like NASA
40:29
historically had done innovations that they then make available to the public there is a place for uh the private
40:38
sector is never going to tackle this problem so we're going to need the government to do it but it's such a
40:43
narrow band of things that focusing on that is going to miss the point of as you pour things into the government
40:49
sector you create a way way way bigger problem and that things like um the X
40:56
prize are probably even better at finding those Solutions than the government ever was in terms of the
41:02
exerprise excuse me the X prise specifically tries to address things that the private
41:08
sector is never going to handle like forest fires uh so you want the government or something like X prise to
41:14
address that I have a feeling X prise is probably better suited but yeah not dogmatic on that in other news there was
41:20
a debate with Piers Morgan and Dave Rubin and uh Gary economics Gary Stevenson they were talking about income
41:26
inequality and one of the things that Gary pitched is the redistribution of wealth so taxing the rich so that they
41:32
pay their fair share let's jump into the snippet I a here to call I never met yon musk I a never met the guy he could be a
41:38
nice have you met him I met him once last year for couple if he wants to copy my book I'll sign one for him we can send over right that's listen I'm not
41:44
here to attack you L Mas you know my point I'm here to I'm here to protect my people's ability to feed and house their
41:50
children and they're losing that but why is that Elon mus cuz he's he's hundreds
41:55
of thousands of people is because wealth inequality is rapidly increasing and wealth is being sucked out midd hear you
42:01
but why but what what can he do about it I don't listen I don't expect Elon Musk to do anything I'm not here to talk to
42:07
Elon Musk I'm here to talk to the American public and to tell them I get paid millions of pounds a year to watch
42:12
your class so what's the answer give me give me your answer if you're not let me let me make you theas any of the things
42:19
that Donald Trump's doing as per the economy or anything that we've seen in the last month I I don't think that they're going to work I don't think
42:24
because because I am somebody who has made Millions pounds betting that growing inequality will reduce living
42:30
standards and he's cutting taxes on the rich listen let me ask you a question right you've already accepted if we
42:35
massively increase inequality that can decrease living standards if we massively decrease tax on the rich
42:40
people who make passive income of 1002 million $200 million a year do you think that will affect living standards of the
42:45
middle class I don't know if they increase their ownership of wealth if they increase their consumption of goods
42:50
and services where does it [ __ ] come from it listen we have we have sat here in the last five years we've watched the
42:56
biggest ever increase in millionaire and billionaire wealth in the history of this planet immediately followed by a
43:02
collapsing living standards of the middle class a complete collapse in the living the ability of orary people to own assets and nobody's drawing the let
43:09
me ask question but yeah this has been an AG old debate the rich had to pay their fair share Gary's point is it
43:17
seems like he's saying that if the if the wealthy class is getting tax breaks
43:22
they're going to consume more things where is that consumption going to come from with the expense of the middle class and I just want to kind of get
43:28
your take on it see how you come from that perspective of it's almost like a zero sum game where if we give these tax
43:35
if we give tax breaks to the rich they are going to buy more houses they are going to buy more cars they are going to buy more things and that will drive the
43:41
price up of a lot of these things so that way the middle income and lower income people are struggling to get their first house or their first car is
43:46
now going to kind of be negatively impacted okay so obviously a very complex issue especially as we introduce
43:52
housing which I think really needs to be set aside that is again a government regulation problem they're limiting the
43:57
number of houses that can be made and the choices that Builders and developers in the local community can make for themselves that's a huge part of that
44:04
problem but setting that aside um this speaks to the Pixar model of problem
44:11
solution uh where I think and I don't know Gary economics well this is basically the longest that I had with
44:16
him was watching that interview uh and what he's saying is we have a problem
44:22
and that problem is we just witnessed since covid the largest weal transfer from the poor and middle class to the
44:28
wealthy and everyone should be screaming bloody murder totally agree that's
44:33
absolutely true and then he tells you how to fix it and at Pixar they would
44:39
get the um writer the director of an animated film in a room every day I
44:45
think to look at the dailies and people will come in and say this is working this is not working it was a very trusted group of people whatever set
44:51
that aside but what Ed kull would tell the director is if somebody tells you that they have a problem something's not
44:56
working for for them you are obligated to listen and to address that problem when they tell you how to solve that
45:02
problem you can ignore them and that's how I feel about Gary economics at least in this uh interview is he has his
45:09
finger on the right problem it is as big of a problem as he's saying it is but his solution where he said it's just tax
45:16
isn't going to work why isn't going to work Drew because he's not being uh he either doesn't understand or isn't being
45:24
honest about what causes this run away Rich get richer poor get poorer what
45:29
ends up happening um with some complexities to set aside around housing which is particular because it's such an
45:35
expensive asset they'll buy up all of what would normally go to an individual home buyer is now going to these gigantic corporations um but what ends
45:44
up happening is because of deficit spending and the need to money print you're robbing everybody's purchasing
45:50
power but then to get that money into the system you're only buying assets obviously I'm really simplifying this
45:57
cuz I've talked about it so many times so once you do that now only people that have assets are able to keep up with the
46:03
inflation and so it just becomes wealthy people are sophisticated enough to know that they need to own assets so they own
46:08
the assets and so their net worth continues to go up whereas the average person just does not pay attention to
46:15
that they don't think about it they probably don't even know what assets are uh the vast majority Believe It or Not don't know what assets are and so now
46:21
they're just getting left behind so if you were to tax the wealthy it wouldn't matter because because it's not going to
46:27
go back into the pockets of the average person because they're just going to keep getting their money inflated away
46:33
and so um if you want to solve the problem you have to balance the budget stop deficit spending so that you can
46:39
stop uh printing money and that is a very simplified version of why I think
46:47
he's right about the problem and wrong about the solution and the solution is what I just said stop [ __ ] printing money now of course many other things
46:55
but the long and the short is until you do that taxing because you can tax the rich at 100% and you still can't pay for
47:01
all the things uh that we need to pay for to run the government that's the part I don't think people understand you could tax people at a
47:07
100% and it doesn't solve the problem so now it's like what are you going to do that isn't the answer we'll get back to
47:14

back to the show yeah get black rock out of housing they shouldn't own bir halfway Black
48:28
Rock you guys should have own more single family houses than individuals that will solve the housing problem overnight um in other news twitch
48:35
streamer I'm not going to try to pronounce that name has done something insane so beating seven from software
48:42
games back to back to back without taking any hits and all at level one it took him 19 hours to do this run he beat
48:49
Demon Souls bloodborne Dark Souls 1 2 and three sakiro in Elden ring all in
48:54
run all in one run without taking damage that is so crazy shees he's like literally crying as he finished it you
49:00
thought he got the gold medal he's the goat and by the way every like gamer is looking at his uh girlfriend wife
49:06
whatever's response at the end uh where he breaks down crying because he's done I mean just imagine if he took damage
49:12
right there oh Jesus yeah uh she comes in gives him a big hug is obviously excited for him uh and I this is gonna
49:20
beg a question for a lot of people is this a good use of this guy's time it's unbelievable what he's accomplished but
49:27
is it a good use of his time and my take on this is if you look at somebody like
49:34
Messi and you're cheering for him this is that level of performance in the
49:40
gaming industry and the only thing that people could say yeah but would be that
49:47
Messi's in physically great shape and you don't have to be in physically great shape to play a game but honestly a lot
49:52
of these Gamers train like athletes CU your mind has to be so sharp like that guy if you test his reflexes they're
49:58
going to be insane of course like his hand eye coordination his reaction time
50:04
insane so I look I'm a gamer bias on the table but uh this is very impressive
50:10
Dark Souls is like infamously hard um yeah these this is not like Mario Brothers yeah like so just to have this
50:17
run of games and to do them all back to back in 19 hours shout out to you dude that's that's a feat we got to try to
50:23
pronounce his name zoom in on that I just literally can't Dino singil oh God and Unice is nowhere
50:31
to be found uh Nico apparently is his name so ni shout out man absolutely
50:36
incredible have you ever had like a game like this that made you stay up all night to beat or like not a long time I
50:41
don't [ __ ] with my sleep ever ever ever uh but back in the day sure my friends and I we would take turns sleeping
50:48
trying to beat Nintendo games because you couldn't save yeah so you you had to beat it like if you were staying the night Saturday to Sunday that was it you
50:54
either beat it then or there was just going to be no beating it so yeah we would sleep in shifts hysterical I want
51:00
say I think it was like PlayStation 3 Vice City was the game I think and I got it for Christmas I beat it I had to
51:05
leave it on all night so I had like marathoned it so like I stayed up till two took like a PowerNet woke up early
51:11
tried to beat it um cuz you never wanted to have the memory card problem and you have to settle over oh that's so brutal
51:17
